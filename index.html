Encompassing the entire continent, <em>Renaissance Architecture</em> examines the rich variety of buildings that emerged during these seminal centuries of European history. <br><br>Although marked by the rise of powerful individuals, both patrons and architects, the Renaissance was equally a time of growing group identities and communities -- and architecture provided the public face to these new identities. Religious reforms in northern Europe, spurred on by Martin Luther, rejected traditional church function and decoration, and proposed new models. Political ambitions required new buildings to satisfy court rituals. Territory, nature, and art intersected to shape new landscapes and building types. Classicism came to be the international language of an educated architect and an ambitious patron, drawing on the legacy of ancient Rome. Yet the richness of the medieval tradition continued to be used throughout Europe, often alongside classical buildings. <br><br>Examining each of these areas by turn, this book offers a broad cultural history of the period as well as a completely new approach to the history of Renaissance architecture. The work of well-known architects such as Michelangelo and Andrea Palladio is examined alongside lesser known though no less innovative designers such as Juan Guas in Portugal and Benedikt Ried in Prague and Eastern Europe. Drawing on the latest research, it also covers more recent areas of interest such as the story of women as patrons and the emotional effect of Renaissance buildings, as well as the impact of architectural publications and travel on the emerging new architectural culture across Europe. As such, it provides a compelling introduction to the subject for all those interested in the history of architecture, society, and culture in the Renaissance, and European culture in general.<br></p><p><br><strong>Christy Anderson</strong> is Associate Professor of Art History at the University of Toronto. She is an architectural historian with a special interest in the buildings of Renaissance and Baroque Europe. As a Kress Fellow at the Courtauld Institute of Art and later as a Research Fellow at Worcester College, Oxford, she studied the annotations made by the English architect Inigo Jones (1573-1652) in his collection of treatises and humanist literature. This work on literacy, architectural language, and the construction of the professional architect appeared in her book <em>Inigo Jones and the Classical</em> <em>Tradition</em> (Cambridge, 2006). Her new work, supported by a fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation, explores the meanings of architectural materials in early modern Europe.<br><br>"Presents a refreshingly lively and thoughtful approach to Renaissance architecture. It is stimulating and original throughout."--Professor Deborah Howard, University of Cambridge<p></p><br></p><h2>Forecasting and Predictive Analytics with Forecast X (TM)</h2><p>Forecasting and Predictive Analytics, Seventh Edition, is the most practical forecasting book on the market with the most powerful software: ForecastX.

Walpole&#x2019;s brooding and intense drama, <em>The Mysterious Mother</em>, focuses on the protagonist&#x2019;s angst over an act of incest with his mother, and includes the appearance of Father Benedict, Gothic literature&#x2019;s first evil monk. </p> <p> Appendices in this edition include selections from Walpole&#x2019;s letters, contemporary responses, and writings illustrating the aesthetic and intellectual climate of the period. Also included is Sir Walter Scott&#x2019;s introduction to the 1811 edition of <em>The Castle of Otranto</em>. </p></p><p><p> <strong>Frederick S. Frank</strong> is Professor Emeritus of English, Allegheny College, Meadville, PA. His books include <em>The First Gothics: A Critical Guide to the English Gothic Novel</em> (Garland, 1987) and <em>The Poe Encyclopedia</em> (Greenwood, 1997). </p><p> &#x201c;Frederick Frank brings together Walpole&#x2019;s controversial play <em>The Mysterious Mother</em> and his seminal Gothic novel <em>The Castle of Otranto</em> in this authoritative edition. Frank&#x2019;s masterly introduction transports the modern reader back to a fresh appreciation of Walpolian &#x2018;gloomth.&#x2019; The edition is an indispensable addition to every Gothicist&#x2019;s book-shelf as well as an invaluable text for students, scholars, and general readers alike.&#x201d; &#x2015; Marie Mulvey-Roberts, University of the West of England, Bristol </p> <p> &#x201c;A valuable tool for any scholar of the Gothic, and especially of Walpole, this book includes a chronology of Walpole&#x2019;s life and work, a collection of his correspondence, responses and reactions to the texts, and a guide to the aesthetic and intellectual backgrounds influencing both texts.&#x201d; &#x2015; <em>Eighteenth-Century Fiction</em> </p></p><h2>Storytelling for Social Justice (Teaching/Learning Social Justice)</h2><p><p>Through accessible language and candid discussions, <em>Storytelling for Social Justice</em> explores the stories we tell ourselves and each other about race and racism in our society. Making sense of the racial constructions expressed through the language and images we encounter every day, this book provides strategies for developing a more critical understanding of how racism operates culturally and institutionally in our society. Using the arts in general, and storytelling in particular, the book examines ways to teach and learn about race by creating counter-storytelling communities that can promote more critical and thoughtful dialogue about racism and the remedies necessary to dismantle it in our institutions and interactions. Illustrated throughout with examples drawn from high school classrooms, teacher education programs, and K-12 professional development programs, the book provides tools for examining racism as well as other issues of social justice. For every teacher who has struggled with how to get the "race discussion" going or who has suffered through silences and antagonism, the innovative model presented in this book offers a practical and critical framework for thinking about and acting on stories about racism and other forms of injustice.</p></p><p><p><strong>Lee Anne Bell</strong> is Professor and Barbara Silver Horowitz Director of Education at Barnard College, Columbia University.</p><p>"Due to its accessibility and adaptability, Storytelling for Social Justice has the potential to alter educational practice and research. In their efforts to create equitable classrooms and curricula, pre-and in-service teachers may reflect upon Bell&#x2019;s discussions of counter-stories to understand how stories uphold or challenge power relations in their lives and the lives of their students. Newcomers to CRT and social justice would applaud Bell&#x2019;s ability to make the theories more accessible."--<strong>Teachers College Record&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>"<em>Storytelling for Social Justice</em> is a gift to educators, activists, writers and those of us caught in the muck of a profoundly racist society that preaches color-blindness. A wise and experienced storyteller, Lee Anne Bell invites us to speak, write and act with courage, offering stories of hope and a pedagogy for justice."--Michelle Fine, Distinguished Professor of Social Psychology, Women&#x2019;s Studies, and Urban Education, The Graduate Center, CUNY</p> <p>"This important book provides a theoretical framework and a practical guide for unmasking contentious and uncomfortable discussions of race and class privilege. Using brilliant analysis of storytelling, Lee Anne Bell helps us understand the complex interactions of students&#x2019; ethnicity and culture and teachers&#x2019; beliefs and attitudes. This is a must read for teachers, teacher educators, and policy makers interested in equity and school reform."-- Jacqueline Jordan Irvine, Candler Professor Emerita, Emory University</p></p><h2>Life and Words: Violence and the Descent into the Ordinary</h2><p>In this powerful, compassionate work, one of anthropology&#x2019;s most distinguished ethnographers weaves together rich fieldwork with a compelling critical analysis in a book that will surely make a signal contribution to contemporary thinking about violence and how it affects everyday life. Veena Das examines case studies including the extreme violence of the Partition of India in 1947 and the massacre of Sikhs in 1984 after the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. In a major departure from much anthropological inquiry, Das asks how this violence has entered "the recesses of the ordinary" instead of viewing it as an interruption of life to which we simply bear witness. Das engages with anthropological work on collective violence, rumor, sectarian conflict, new kinship, and state and bureaucracy as she embarks on a wide-ranging exploration of the relations among violence, gender, and subjectivity. Weaving anthropological and philosophical reflections on the ordinary into her analysis, Das points toward a new way of interpreting violence in societies and cultures around the globe. The book will be indispensable reading across disciplinary boundaries as we strive to better understand violence, especially as it is perpetrated against women.</p><p><b>Veena Das</b> is Krieger-Eisenhower Professor of Anthropology and Professor of Humanities at Johns Hopkins University and a founding member of the Institute of Socio-Economic Research in Development and Democracy. Among her books is <i>Violence and Subjectivity,</i> which she coedited with Arthur Kleinman, Mamphela Ramphele, and Pamela Reynolds (UC Press). <b>Stanley Cavell</b> is Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at Harvard University.</p><h2>Introduction to Healthcare Quality Management, Second Edition (Gateway to Healthcare Management)</h2><p><p><em>Introduction to Healthcare Quality Management,</em> Second Edition, explains the basic principles and techniques of quality management in healthcare.

After a brief biography of Plotinus, Professor Rist discusses, among other topics, Plotinus&#39; concept of the one, the logos and free will and ends with a discussion of faith in Plotinus and later in Neoplatonism. Perhaps because he is strictly neither a classical nor a medieval philosopher Plotinus&#39; work has been rather neglected in the English-speaking world. Professor Rist has rescued him from this relative obscurity and has indicated some of the ways in which he has influenced both Christian and non-Christian philosophers.</p><p>This 1967 study of Plotinus&#39; philosophy was the first comprehensive work in English since Inge&#39;s The Philosophy of Plotinus was published early in the twentieth century.

In Evocative Objects, Turkle collects writings by scientists, humanists, artists, and designers that trace the power of everyday things. These essays reveal objects as emotional and intellectual companions that anchor memory, sustain relationships, and provoke new ideas.These days, scholars show new interest in the importance of the concrete. This volume's special contribution is its focus on everyday riches: the simplest of objects--an apple, a datebook, a laptop computer--are shown to bring philosophy down to earth. The poet contends, "No ideas but in things." The notion of evocative objects goes further: objects carry both ideas and passions. In our relations to things, thought and feeling are inseparable.Whether it's a student's beloved 1964 Ford Falcon (left behind for a station wagon and motherhood), or a cello that inspires a meditation on fatherhood, the intimate objects in this collection are used to reflect on larger themes--the role of objects in design and play, discipline and desire, history and exchange, mourning and memory, transition and passage, meditation and new vision.In the interest of enriching these connections, Turkle pairs each autobiographical essay with a text from philosophy, history, literature, or theory, creating juxtapositions at once playful and profound. So we have Howard Gardner's keyboards and Lev Vygotsky's hobbyhorses; William Mitchell's Melbourne train and Roland Barthes' pleasures of text; Joseph Cevetello's glucometer and Donna Haraway's cyborgs. Each essay is framed by images that are themselves evocative. Essays by Turkle begin and end the collection, inviting us to look more closely at the everyday objects of our lives, the familiar objects that drive our routines, hold our affections, and open out our world in unexpected ways.</p></p><p>all three published by the MIT Press.<p>"Original, absorbing, and beautifully written, this collection of essays will forever change the way you look at the objects in your life."--Helen Epstein, author of *Children of the Holocaust* and *Where She Came From: A Daughter's Search for her Mother's History*</p><br><br><p>" <i>Evocative Objects</i> is a collection of great richness and complexity.

In <i>Money Changes Everything</i>, leading financial historian William Goetzmann argues the exact opposite&#x2015;that the development of finance has made the growth of civilizations possible. Goetzmann explains that finance is a time machine, a technology that allows us to move value forward and backward through time; and that this innovation has changed the very way we think about and plan for the future. He shows how finance was present at key moments in history: driving the invention of writing in ancient Mesopotamia, spurring the classical civilizations of Greece and Rome to become great empires, determining the rise and fall of dynasties in imperial China, and underwriting the trade expeditions that led Europeans to the New World. He also demonstrates how the apparatus we associate with a modern economy&#x2015;stock markets, lines of credit, complex financial products, and international trade&#x2015;were repeatedly developed, forgotten, and reinvented over the course of human history.</p><p>Exploring the critical role of finance over the millennia, and around the world, Goetzmann details how wondrous financial technologies and institutions&#x2015;money, bonds, banks, corporations, and more&#x2015;have helped urban centers to expand and cultures to flourish. And it's not done reshaping our lives, as Goetzmann considers the challenges we face in the future, such as how to use the power of finance to care for an aging and expanding population.</p><p><i>Money Changes Everything</i> presents a fascinating look into the way that finance has steered the course of history.</p></p><p><p>"Only William Goetzmann--an archaeologist, art historian, and esteemed finance scholar--could have produced this masterful exploration of money and investing through the ages. <i>Money Changes Everything</i> is at once deep, broad, sweeping, and gorgeously illustrated. It is a book that readers will savor and refer to again and again."<b>--William Bernstein, author of <i>A Splendid Exchange: How Trade Shaped the World</i></b></p><p>"Money is the greatest invention since the wheel. In this masterwork, <i>Money Changes Everything</i>, William Goetzmann traces money's role from prehistoric times to the present, showing how civilizations developed on a bedrock of financial transactions. A beautifully written and compelling book."<b>--Elroy Dimson, University of Cambridge and London Business School</b></p><p>"In <i>Money Changes Everything</i>, readers learn a tremendous amount about the core ideas of finance. William Goetzmann uses a vast range of historical examples to explain why the evolution of finance and civilization are inseparable."<b>--Robert J. Shiller, Nobel Laureate in Economics</b></p><p>"In this engaging book, William Goetzmann, a modern Renaissance man, demonstrates that throughout recorded history, the power of financial technologies has improved human existence. Like other technologies, financial innovations can sometimes be disruptive. Goetzmann, however, shows us that much of the time, these innovations propel economic progress and expand individual opportunities."<b>--Richard Sylla, Stern School of Business, New York University</b></p><p>"If anyone had told me that someone could write coherently and intelligently about Karl Marx, cuneiform tablets, the South Sea bubble, the opium trade, and David's painting <i>Death of Marat</i> between a single set of covers, I would have shaken my head in disbelief. This book accomplishes precisely this. <i>Money Changes Everything</i> does nothing less than to think through the contribution of finance to modern civilization. A thrilling read."<b>--Hans-Joachim Voth, University of Zurich</b></p><p>"Ranging from early civilizations to the present day and moving from the Fertile Crescent to our current global society, this book contains a wealth of interesting observations about the history of finance. Readers will be attracted by the genial tone and tales of personal discovery."<b>--Peter Temin, Massachusetts Institute of Technology</b></p><p>"This is a long-term history of the development and importance of financial technologies and institutions. A useful synthesis that brings together primary materials, the book argues that financial systems provide the means for advancing civilization."<b>--Graham Oliver, Brown University</b></p><b>William N. Goetzmann</b> is the Edwin J. Beinecke Professor of Finance and Management and director of the International Center for Finance at the Yale School of Management. His books include <i>The Origins of Value: The Financial Innovations that Created the Modern Financial Markets</i> and <i>The Great Mirror of Folly: Finance, Culture, and the Crash of 1720</i>.</p><h2>Programming Logic and Design, Introductory</h2><p>Prepare for programming success by learning the fundamental principles of developing structured program logic with Farrell&#39;s PROGRAMMING LOGIC AND DESIGN: INTRODUCTORY, 9E.

This unique collection of previously unpublished film treatments, short stories, and one-act plays spans fifty years of her creative writing and showcases the breadth and depth of her talent. Beginning in 1912 with the stories she submitted from her San Diego home (some made into films by D. W. Griffith), through her collaboration with Colette on the play <i>Gigi, </i>Anita Loos wrote almost every day for the screen, stage, books, or magazines. Film scripts include <i>San Francisco, The Women, </i>and <i>Red-Headed Woman. </i>The list of stars for whom she created unforgettable roles includes Mary Pickford, Jean Harlow, Clark Gable, Audrey Hepburn, and Carol Channing. <br><br>This collection has been selected by Anita's niece and close friend, the best-selling author Mary Anita Loos, together with the acclaimed film historian Cari Beauchamp. Their essays are laced throughout the volume, introducing each section and giving previously untold insights and behind-the-scenes stories about Anita&#x2015;her life, her friendships, and her times.</p><p>"I adored Anita, as did the entire fashion and literary world. She was four feet nine inches of lithe, slender, dramatic chic."--Carol Channing<p>"This book celebrates a character as memorable as any Anita Loos created in her writing.

Her life epitomizes a certain era in show business and describes a Hollywood in which few women were allowed to rise to the top. Anita Loos did and we were all the beneficiaries.

Set by the Mississippi River in the 1840's, it follows these boys as they get into predicament after predicament. Tom's classic whitewashing of the fence has become part of American legend, and the book paints a nostalgic picture of life in the middle of the nineteenth century. Tom runs away from home to an island in the river, chases Injun Joe and his treasure, and even gets trapped in a cave for days with Becky Thatcher. The book is one of Twain's most beloved stories.</p></p><p></p><h2>Arthur Mervyn; or, Memoirs of the Year 1793: With Related Texts (Hackett Classics)</h2><p><p>Set during the epic Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic of 1793, Charles Brockden Brown's classic gothic novel <i>Arthur Mervyn; or, Memoirs of the Year 1793</i> connects the outbreak with the upheavals of the revolutionary era and the murderous financial networks of Atlantic slavery.</p><p>This edition of <i>Arthur Mervyn</i> offers selections from key contemporary texts as well as excerpts from Brown's own writings on slavery, race, and the uses of history in fiction.</p></p><p>"Essential reading for anyone interested in the origins of the United States" <p> Set during the epic Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic of 1793, Charles Brockden Brown's classic gothic novel <i>Arthur Mervyn; or, Memoirs of the Year 1793</i> connects the outbreak with the upheavals of the revolutionary era and the murderous financial networks of Atlantic slavery. </p><p> This edition of <i>Arthur Mervyn</i> offers selections from key contemporary texts as well as excerpts from Brown's own writings on slavery, race, and the uses of history in fiction. </p><p> "This new edition of <i>Arthur Mervyn</i> far exceeds any previous version of this remarkable American novel.

But fortunately this does not really matter. The principal ideas of the book can be understood even if the reader follows only one of the many lines of the discussion. The other aspects merely add stereoscopic depth to the argument, but not really new substance. May I, then, ask the reader not to be irritated by the obscurity of some of the material, to take out from the book what appeals to him and leave the rest unread? In a way this kind of reading needs what I will call a syncretistic approach. Children can listen breathlessly to a tale of which they understand only little. In the words of William James they take 'flying leaps' over long stretches that elude their understanding and fasten on the few points that appeal to them. They are still able to profit from this incomplete understanding. This ability of understanding- and it is an ability may be due to their syncretistic capacity to comprehend a total structure rather than analysing single elements. Child art too goes for the total structure without bothering about analytic details. I myself seem to have preserved some of this ability. This enables me to read technical books with some profit even if I am not conversant with some of the technical terms. A reader who cannot take 'flying leaps' over portions of technical information which he cannot understand will become of necessity a rather narrow specialist. It is an advantage therefore to retain some of the child's syncretistic ability, in order to escape excessive specialization. This book is certainly not for the man who can digest his information only within a well-defined range of technical terms.&nbsp;A publisher's reader once objected to my lack of focus. What he meant was that the argument had a tendency to jump from high psychological theory to highly practical recipes for art teaching and the like; scientific jargon mixed with mundane everyday language. This kind of treatment may well appear chaotic to an orderly mind. Yet I feel quite unrepentant. I realize that the apparently chaotic and scattered structure of my writing fits the subject matter of this book, which deals with the deceptive chaos in art's vast substructure. There is a 'hidden order' in this chaos which only a properly attuned reader or art lover can grasp. All artistic structure is essentially 'polyphonic'; it evolves not in a single line of thought, but in several superimposed strands at once. Hence creativity requires a diffuse, scattered kind of attention that contradicts our normal logical habits of thinking. Is it too high a claim to say that the polyphonic argument of my book must be read with this creative type of attention? I do not think that a reader who wants to proceed on a single track will understand the complexity of art and creativity in general anyway. So why bother about him? Even the most persuasive and logical argument cannot make up for his lack of sensitivity. On the other hand I have reason to hope that a reader who is attuned to the hidden substructure of art will find no difficulty in following the diffuse and scattered structure of my exposition.&nbsp;There is of course an intrinsic order in the progress of the book. Like most thinking on depth-psychology it proceeds from the conscious surface to the deeper levels of the unconscious. The first chapters deal with familiar technical and professional problems of the artist. Gradually aspects move into view that defy this kind of rational analysis. For instance the plastic effects of painting (pictorial space) which are familiar to every artist and art lover tum out to be determined by deeply unconscious perceptions. They ultimately evade all conscious control. In this way a profound conflict between conscious and unconscious (spontaneous) control comes forward. The conflict proves to be akin to the conflict of single-track thought and 'polyphonic' scattered attention which I have described. Conscious thought is sharply focused and highly differentiated in its elements; the deeper we penetrate into low-level imagery and phantasy the more the single track divides and branches into unlimited directions so that in the end its structure appears chaotic. The creative thinker is capabte of alternating between differentiated and undifferentiated modes of thinking, harnessing them together to give him service for solving very definite tasks. The uncreative psychotic succumbs to the tension between conscious (differentiated) and unconscious (undifferentiated) modes of mental functioning. As he cannot integrate their divergent functions, true chaos ensues. The unconscious functions overcome and fragment the conscious surface sensibilities and tear reason into shreds. Modern art displays this attack of unreason on reason quite openly. Yet owing to the powers of the creative mind real disaster is averted. Reason may seem to be cast aside for a moment. Modern art seems truly chaotic. But as time passes by the 'hidden order' in art's substructure (the work of unconscious form creation) rises to the surface. The modern artist may attack his own reason and single-track thought; but a new order is already in the making.</p><p>"One of the most intelligent books ever written about the psychology of artistic creativity. . . . as relevant to the present situation of psychology as it is to the present situation of art."--John Russell, <i>The Sunday Times (London)</i>&nbsp;"In his remarkable study he has evolved an altogether new psychology of the artist and the art-work which accounts particularly for the development, significance, possibilities and limitations of modern abstract art."--<i>The Times Literary Supplement</i>Anton Ehrenzweig</p><h2>The Burden of Southern History</h2><p><p>C. Vann Woodward's The Burden of Southern History remains one of the essential history texts of our time. In it Woodward brilliantly addresses the interrelated themes of southern identity, southern distinctiveness, and the strains of irony that characterize much of the South's historical experience. First published in 1960, the book quickly became a touchstone for generations of students. This updated third edition contains a chapter, "Look Away, Look Away," in which Woodward finds a plethora of additional ironies in the South's experience. It also includes previously uncollected appreciations of Robert Penn Warren, to whom the book was originally dedicated, and William Faulkner. This edition also features a new foreword by historian William E. Leuchtenburg in which he recounts the events that led up to Woodward's writing The Burden of Southern History, and reflects on the book's -- and Woodward's -- place in the study of southern history. The Burden of Southern History is quintessential Woodward -- wise, witty, ruminative, daring, and as alive in the twenty-first century as when it was written.</p></p><p><p>C. Vann Woodward (1908--1999) was Sterling Professor of History Emeritus at Yale University, where he taught from 1961 until 1977. One of the leading historians of the century, Woodward wrote several books about the American South, his main field of interest. He edited Mary Chesnut's Civil War, for which he received the 1982 Pulitzer Prize for history. His other major works include Tom Watson: Agrarian Rebel; American Counterpoint; The Strange Career of Jim Crow; Reunion and Reaction; Thinking Back: The Perils of Writing History; and Origins of the New South, 1877--1913, for which he received the Bancroft Prize. He served as president of the Southern Historical Association, the Organization of American Historians, and the American Historical Association, and was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. <br>William E. Leuchtenburg is William Rand Kenan, Jr., Professor Emeritus at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the author of more than a doezen books on twentieth-century American history, including The White House Looks South: Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Lyndon B.

It recounts in vivid historical detail the turbulent years at the close of the Han Dynasty when China broke into three competing kingdoms and over half the population were either killed or driven from their homes. Part myth, part fact, readers will experience the loyalty and treachery, the brotherhood and rivalry of China's legendary heroes and villains during the most tumultuous period in Chinese history.<br><br>Considered the most significant work in classic Chinese literature, <i>The Three Kingdoms</i> is read by millions throughout Asia today. Seen not just as a great work of art, many Chinese view it as a guide to success in life and business as well as a work that offers moral clarity&#x2014;while many foreigners read it to gain insights into Chinese society and culture. From the saga of <i>The Three Kingdoms</i>, readers will learn how great warriors motivate their troops and enhance their influence while disguising their weaknesses and turning the strengths of others against them.<br><br><b>This third volume concludes the tale of Liu Bei and his sworn brothers-in-arms, Zhang Fei and Guan Yu, whose loyalty and fidelity are sorely tested in a society at war for its very survival.</b></p><p><b>Ron Iverson</b> first visited China in 1984 as the personal representative of the Mayor of Chicago as part of a Sister Cities program. For the past 30 years, he has continued to visit China regularly and has founded joint business ventures with Chinese partners and taught Business Strategy at Tongji University in Shanghai. He also personally arranged the first ever exhibition of Forbidden City artifacts from the Palace Museum in Beijing to tour the US. Early in his visits to China, Iverson discovered <i>The Three Kingdoms</i> and came to realize the enormous cultural significance the Chinese people place in the book. Believing that one needed to be familiar with the principles revealed in the book in order to find business or political success in China, and being dissatisfied with existing translations, Iverson decided to fund and edit a new translation aimed towards delivering the thrill of a contemporary novel while imparting understanding of a key aspect of Chinese culture. <br><br><b>Yu Sumei</b> is a professor of English at East China Normal University. She has translated several English language books into Chinese and is the first native Chinese speaker to translate <i>The Three Kingdoms</i> into English. She invested a total of two years into working on this new translation of <i>The Three Kingdoms</i>, spending the time on sabbatical in New York with her daughter, who typed the translation out as she completed it."This translation faithfully conveys a native Chinese-speaking person's understanding of this most influential and famous Chinese book. To translate this Chinese classic into modern English is a challenging and difficult job for any language translator.

Many, once you have an idea, show you how to express it clearly and elegantly. And many handbooks offer reliable advice on the use of commas, semicolons, and so forth. But <em>The New Oxford</em> <em>Guide to Writing</em> does all three, so that no matter where you find yourself in the writing process--from the daunting look of a blank page, to the rough draft that needs shaping, to the small but important questions of punctuation--you will find what you need in one handy, all-inclusive volume.<br> Highlighted by numerous examples of successful prose--including marvelous, brief excerpts from Mark Twain, Joan Didion, H.L. Mencken, E.B. White, and Annie Dillard--this stimulating volume covers the entire subject step-by-step, clearly and authoritatively.

Very few of those books, surprisingly, offer a thorough and scholarly approach to the basics: words, sentences, and paragraphs. <i>The New Oxford Guide to Writing</i> does. According to author Thomas S. Kane, writing is "an exercise of mind requiring the mastery of techniques anyone can learn." Kane's not claiming he can create a genius, but, as he says in his introduction, "you don't have to be a genius to write clear, effective English." The writing that Kane refers to here is expository and persuasive in nature--writing most likely to be required in day-to-day life. In great detail Kane explores the building of an essay, the development of paragraphs, the styling of sentences, the use of diction, and, finally, issues of punctuation. It is unlikely that very many writers have scrutinized the building blocks of language the way Kane has, but it's never too late. Rare is the sourcebook that can offer so much both to beginners and experts alike. And anyone who loves words will thrill to encounter--if he or she hasn't done so already--the freight-train sentence, parataxis, the triadic sentence, polysyndeton, asyndeton, collocation, and zeugma. <i>--Jane Steinberg</i><br><em>About the Author</em>: <br><strong>Thomas Kane</strong> was formerly Professor of English at the University of Connecticut at Waterbury, where he taught writing for over twenty-five years.

Echoes of Yossarian, the wise-ass bombardier who was too smart to die but not smart enough to find a way out of his predicament, could be heard throughout the counterculture. As a result, it's impossible not to consider <i>Catch-22</i> to be something of a period piece. But 40 years on, the novel's undiminished strength is its looking-glass logic. Again and again, Heller's characters demonstrate that what is commonly held to be good, is bad; what is sensible, is nonsense. <p> Yossarian says, "You're talking about winning the war, and I am talking about winning the war and keeping alive." <br> "Exactly," Clevinger snapped smugly. "And which do you think is more important?" <br> "To whom?" Yossarian shot back. "It doesn't make a damn bit of difference who wins the war to someone who's dead." <br> "I can't think of another attitude that could be depended upon to give greater comfort to the enemy." <br> "The enemy," retorted Yossarian with weighted precision, "is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on." <br> Mirabile dictu, the book holds up post-Reagan, post-Gulf War. It's a good thing, too. As long as there's a military, that engine of lethal authority, <i>Catch-22</i> will shine as a handbook for smart-alecky pacifists. It's an utterly serious and sad, but damn funny book.</p>Joseph Heller was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1923. In 1961, he published Catch-22, which became a bestseller and, in 1970, a film. He went on to write such novels as Something Happened, God Knows, Picture This, Closing Time (the sequel to Catch-22), and Portrait of an Artist, as an Old Man. Heller died in December 1999.</p><h2>Teacher Created Materials - Primary Source Readers: The Texas Revolution - Fighting for Independence - Grade 4 - Guided Reading Level S</h2><p>In 1833, American and Tejano colonists wanted independence from the Mexican government.

It engages critically with the studies in order to reveal new ways of thinking both about them and about the ideas they explore. In effect, it shows how Developmental Psychology can be - and has been - taken forward in exciting ways through a careful re-examination of the core studies that lie at its heart. <p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>Introduction to Developmental Psychology is a representative and authoritative state of the art&#39; account of human development from conception to adolescence. The book is organised chronologically and also thematically, and each chapter is written by internationally renowned experts who convey their knowledge with enthusiasm and skill. There are five major sections. In the Introduction the scope, methods and theories of developmental psychology are described together with a detailed account of the nature-nurture issue. The next three sections Infancy, Childhood, and Adolescence give a comprehensive account of the major developments, and the last major section, Practical issues, presents implications and findings on educational issues, bullying, and disorders of development.The book comes with full supporting materials discussion questions, suggestions for further readings, chapter overviews and glossary and its own website which (amongst other material) provides figures for powerpoint presentations and multiple choice questions for student and instructor use.This is a truly international account of theories, findings and issues in human development.

The second part concentrates on the intercultural relations between the Middle East and Europe, while the third part considers implications for oriental and development studies: the new demands arising and the perceptual and methodological retooling needed to meet them.<br>In singling out the intercultural nature of events and clashes, this important volume advances an innovative, interactive style of scholarship.</p><p><b>C.A.O. van Nieuwenhuijze</b>, Ph.D. (1945), University of Leiden, Professor Emeritus of Sociology, Institute of Social Studies, The Hague, Netherlands, has published extensively on Indonesian Islam, the sociocultural dimension of Third World development, the sociology of the Middle East and intercultural problems.</p><h2>Living Justice: Catholic Social Teaching in Action</h2><p>For over a decade Living Justice has introduced readers to Catholic social teaching. Grounded in scripture, theology, reason, and experience, these faith-based principles for promoting justice and peace in modern society have inspired a remarkable burst of social activism in recent decades. The second classroom edition has been revised and updated throughout while maintaining the book&#39;s accessible introduction to both the foundations of Catholic social teaching and social justice in the world today. Living Justice leads readers step-by-step through the building blocks of Catholic social thought, including its central themes, sources, and methods. Along the way readers encounter great heroes of social change and prophets of peace and justice. Key updates to the second classroom edition include further reflection on the use of the just-war theory in light of events in Iraq and Afghanistan, the revival of terrorist threats, the papacy of Benedict XVI, the social encyclical Caritas in Veritate, the recent financial crisis, business ethics today, and ongoing environmental concerns. With its helpful resources, including discussion questions and an annotated list of print and web resources on Catholic social teaching, Living Justice remains a perfect text for courses on social justice.</p><p>Thomas J. Massaro, S.J., is professor of moral theology at Boston College School of Theology and Ministry.Massaro provides a necessary companion text to any course that deals with issues of social justice, the role of the Church in the modern world, or the relationship between religion and public policy. It is simultaneously academically rigorous and easily accessible to students. Broad, honest, and practical, it serves a variety of courses and invites much needed dialogue between religion that has become increasingly privatized in the public square. (Brian Scott)<br><br>This new, updated edition of <i>Living Justice</i> will be enthusiastically welcomed by all who want to give their students an accurate, comprehensive, and reader-friendly introduction to Catholic social teaching. (Jon Nilson)<br><br>I am grateful for this updated edition of Tom Massaro's <i>Living Justice</i>. I have used the earlier edition for several years now, and my students have found it a clear and accessible presentation. However, as Fr. Massaro notes, Catholic social teaching is not a static genre as Benedict XVI extended and enriched it with his Encyclical <i>Caritas in Veritate</i> in 2009. The new edition integrates this important contribution, particularly in Benedict's treatment of the global economy and the environment. I continue to find particularly helpful the Questions for Reflection provided at the end of each chapter, as well as the quite useful section on Applying Catholic Social Teaching in the Real World, always the challenge for my students and for all of us in the Church. (James R. Stormes, S.J.)<br><br>I enthusiastically endorse the text for the following reasons: 1. The text balances and integrates very well the historical development of Catholic Social Teaching, the core values of CST, and its application to present day and future societal issues. 2. The &#x201c;Questions for Reflection&#x201d; at the end of chapters is an excellent pedagogical feature. I will recommend to my students that they read the questions first in order to provide them a context in which to read the specific chapter. 3. For courses and programs that require a strong writing component, Massaro&#x2019;s suggestions contained in the 'Topics for Further Research' provide a valuable assistance for both students and instructor. 4. The interdisciplinary nature of the text would be an excellent requirement for a 'Learning-Community&#x201d;'project which links a Catholic Social Teaching course with an appropriate course in Political Science, Sociology or History or as a supplemental text in any course exploring Social Justice regardless of the discipline. 5. The text is extremely accessible to undergraduates, parish adult education programs and at the same time quite appropriate for the graduate level course. (Peter H.

He began inventing these stories in his American wife&#39;s hometown of Brattleboro, Vermont, to amuse his eldest daughter--and they have served ever since as a source of laughter for children everywhere.<br> <br> <b>Joseph Rudyard Kipling</b> was an English journalist, short-story writer, poet, and novelist. <br> <br> Kipling's works of fiction include <i>The Jungle Book</i> (1894), <i>Kim</i> (1901), and many short stories, including <i>"The Man Who Would Be King"</i> (1888). His poems include <i>"Mandalay" (1890), "Gunga Din" (1890), "The Gods of the Copybook Headings" (1919), "The White Man's Burden" (1899)</i>, and <i>"If&#x2014;"</i> (1910). He is regarded as a major innovator in the art of the short story; his children's books are classics of children's literature, and one critic described his work as exhibiting "a versatile and luminous narrative gift". <br> <br> Kipling was one of the most popular writers in the United Kingdom, in both prose and verse, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Henry James said: "Kipling strikes me personally as the most complete man of genius (as distinct from fine intelligence) that I have ever known." In 1907, at the age of 41, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, making him the first English-language writer to receive the prize, and its youngest recipient to date. He was also sounded out for the British Poet Laureateship and on several occasions for a knighthood, both of which he declined. <br> <br> Awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1907 "in consideration of the power of observation, originality of imagination, virility of ideas and remarkable talent for narration which characterize the creations of this world-famous author." <br> <br> Kipling kept writing until the early 1930s, but at a slower pace and with much less success than before. On the night of 12 January 1936, Kipling suffered a haemorrhage in his small intestine. He underwent surgery, but died less than a week later on 18 January 1936 at the age of 70 of a perforated duodenal ulcer. Kipling's death had in fact previously been incorrectly announced in a magazine, to which he wrote, "I've just read that I am dead.

According to Thornhill and Palmer, evolved adaptation of some sort gives rise to rape; the main evolutionary question is whether rape is an adaptation itself or a by-product of other adaptations. Regardless of the answer, Thornhill and Palmer note, rape circumvents a central feature of women's reproductive strategy: mate choice. This is a primary reason why rape is devastating to its victims, especially young women. Thornhill and Palmer address, and claim to demolish scientifically, many myths about rape bred by social science theory over the past twenty-five years. The popular contention that rapists are not motivated by sexual desire is, they argue, scientifically inaccurate.<br> <br> Although they argue that rape is biological, Thornhill and Palmer do not view it as inevitable. Their recommendations for rape prevention include teaching young males not to rape, punishing rape more severely, and studying the effectiveness of "chemical castration." They also recommend that young women consider the biological causes of rape when making decisions about dress, appearance, and social activities. Rape could cease to exist, they argue, only in a society knowledgeable about its evolutionary causes.<br> <br> The book includes a useful summary of evolutionary theory and a comparison of evolutionary biology's and social science's explanations of human behavior. The authors argue for the greater explanatory power and practical usefulness of evolutionary biology. The book is sure to stir up discussion both on the specific topic of rape and on the larger issues of how we understand and influence human behavior.</p><p>Evolutionary psychology often stomps where other branches of science fear to tread. Case in point: <i>A Natural History of Rape</i>. Randy Thornhill, a biologist, and Craig T. Palmer, an anthropologist, have attempted to apply evolutionary principles to one of the most disgusting of human behaviors, and the result is a guaranteed storm of media hype and debate. The book's central argument is that rape is a genetically developed strategy sustained over generations of human life because it is a kind of sexual selection--a successful reproductive strategy. This runs directly counter to the prevailing notion--that rape is predominantly about violent power, and only secondarily about sex. <p> The authors base their argument partly on statistics showing that in the United States, most rape victims are of childbearing age. But disturbingly large numbers of rapes of children, elderly women, and other men are never adequately explained. And the actual reproductive success of rape is not clear. Thornhill and Palmer's biological interpretation is just that--an interpretation, one that won't withstand tough scientific scrutiny. They further claim that the mental trauma of rape is greater for women of childbearing age (especially married women) than it is for elderly women or children. The data supporting these assertions come from a single psychological study, done by Thornhill in the 1970s, that mixes first-person interviews with caretaker's interpretations of children's reactions. </p><p> While Thornhill and Palmer claim that they are trying to look objectively at the root causes of rape, they focus almost entirely on data that support their thesis, forcing them to write an evolutionary "just-so" story. The central problem is evident in this quote, from the chapter "The Pain and Anguish of Rape":</p><p> </p><blockquote>We feel that the woman's perspective on rape can be best understood by considering the negative influences of rape on female reproductive success.... It is also highly possible that selection favored the outward manifestations of psychological pain because it communicated the female's strong negative attitude about the rapist to her husband and/or her relatives.</blockquote><p> Women are disturbed by rape mostly because they are worried about what their husbands might think? In statements like this, the authors repeatedly discount the psychological aspects of rape, such as fear, humiliation, loss of autonomy, and powerlessness, and focus solely on personal shame. </p><p> <i>A Natural History of Rape</i> will no doubt have people talking about rape and its causes, and perhaps thinking about real ways of preventing it. In fact, the authors suggest that all young men be educated frankly about their (theoretical) genetic desire to rape. And it reopens the debate about the role of sex in rape. But without more and better data supporting their conclusions, Thornhill and Palmer are doing the very thing they criticize feminists and social scientists of doing: just talking. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>Randy Thornhill is Regents&#39; Professor and Professor of Biology at the University of New Mexico.</p><h2>A Deadly Wandering: A Mystery, a Landmark Investigation, and the Astonishing Science of Attention in the Digital Age</h2><p><p>"Deserves a spot next to&nbsp;<em>Fast Food Nation</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>&nbsp;in America&#x2019;s high school curriculums.

In this long-awaited book, completed shortly before its author's death, Evans recasts the idea of the relationship between geometry and architecture, drawing on mathematics, engineering, art history, and aesthetics to uncover processes in the imagining and realizing of architectural form. He shows that geometry does not always play a stolid and dormant role but, in fact, may be an active agent in the links between thinking and imagination, imagination and drawing, drawing and building. He suggests a theory of architecture that is based on the many transactions between architecture and geometry as evidenced in individual buildings, largely in Europe, from the fifteenth to the twentieth century.</p><p>From the Henry VII chapel at Westminster Abbey to Le Corbusier's Ronchamp, from Raphael's S. Eligio and the work of Piero della Francesca and Philibert Delorme to Guarino Guarini and the painters of cubism, Evans explores the geometries involved, asking whether they are in fact the stable underpinnings of the creative, intuitive, or rhetorical aspects of architecture. In particular he concentrates on the history of architectural projection, the geometry of vision that has become an internalized and pervasive pictorial method of construction and that, until now, has played only a small part in the development of architectural theory.</p><p>Evans describes the ambivalent role that pictures play in architecture and urges resistance to the idea that pictures provide all that architects need, suggesting that there is much more within the scope of the architect's vision of a project than what can be drawn. He defines the different fields of projective transmission that concern architecture, and investigates the ambiguities of projection and the interaction of imagination with projection and its metaphors.</p></p><p>Architect, teacher, historian, and theoretician, Robin Evans (1944-1993) was Visiting Professor, Graduate School of Design, Harvard University; Lecturer, University of Westminster, London; and Visiting Lecturer, Architectural Association, London.-- Andrew Ballantyne, "Times Literary Supplement"<br><br>" Robin Evans, in his brilliant (sadly posthumous) book "The Projective Cast," explores some of the properties of intersecting arcs, flying lines and similar triangles in a series of essays which work both as an introduction to a range of geometries, and as impressively well-informed accounts of episodes in cultural history.

But why do we insult each other? Why do insults cause us such pain? Can we do anything to prevent or lessen this pain? Most importantly, how can we overcome our inclination to insult others?<br> <br>In <em>A Slap in the Face,</em> William Irvine undertakes a wide-ranging investigation of insults, their history, the role they play in social relationships, and the science behind them. He examines not just memorable zingers, such as Elizabeth Bowen's description of Aldous Huxley as "The stupid person's idea of a clever person," but subtle insults as well, such as when someone insults us by reporting the insulting things others have said about us: "I never read bad reviews about myself," wrote entertainer Oscar Levant, "because my best friends invariably tell me about them." Irvine also considers the role insults play in our society: they can be used to cement relations, as when a woman playfully teases her husband, or to enforce a social hierarchy, as when a boss publicly berates an employee. He goes on to investigate the many ways society has tried to deal with insults-by adopting codes of politeness, for example, and outlawing hate speech-but concludes that the best way to deal with insults is to immunize ourselves against them: We need to transform ourselves in the manner recommended by Stoic philosophers. We should, more precisely, become insult pacifists, trying hard not to insult others and laughing off their attempts to insult us.<br><br>A rousing follow-up to <em>A Guide to the Good Life, A Slap in the Face</em> will interest anyone who's ever delivered an insult or felt the sting of one--in other words, everyone.<br></p><p><br><strong>William B. Irvine </strong>is Professor of Philosophy at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio. His books include <em>A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy</em>, <em>On Desire: Why We Want What We Want</em>, and <em>Aha!: The Moments of Insight that Shape Our World</em>.<br><br>"<em>A Slap in the Face</em> is an earnest book offering some good advice as well as some memorable insults." --Daniel Akst, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> <br><p></p><br>"Readers looking to add to their stock of insults will find much good material here, but they'll also find an insightful analysis of the way we insult each other, why we do it, how we react, and how we can adjust our notion of insults and modify our reactions to them...Written in a lively, entertaining style..." --<em>Booklist</em><p></p><br>"We may not like to admit it, but the impulse to wound with words has long been a part of human history, Irvine contends in this m�lange of philosophy, psychology, and cultural study. Insults may range from barbs meant as flirtatious bait to the famously eloquent gibes of Shakespeare, but Irvine pragmatically argues that regardless of intention or context, we must understand insults in order to deal with them." --<em>Publishers Weekly</em> <br><p></p><br>"After providing readers with a catalog of amusing insults, Irvine analyzes the role they play in everyday life and offers invaluable advice for reducing their sting. His suggestion that you laugh at yourself when you are insulted--a form of verbal aikido--is nearly foolproof." <br>--Mark Frauenfelder, founding editor of BoingBoing.net and editor-in-chief of the technology magazine <em>Make</em> <br><p></p><br>"This intriguing book is written in a very engaging style about a topic to which everyone can relate. William Irvine uses leading research in the field to present information in a very accessible manner about the various forms that insults can take, reactions that people have to insults, and ways to more appropriately respond to insults. The points that Irvine makes will 'slap you in the face' as you quickly become aware of the prevalence of insults, your own and others, in your daily life."--Robin Kowalski, Professor of Psychology, Clemson University <br><p></p><br>"Aristotle said we were rational animals, but the Stoics noticed that we were insulting animals. Other animals establish social hierarchies with claws and fangs, we do so with words. William Irvine is a collector and a connoisseur of insults, and well-chosen examples keep this book lively. But he also understands insults; he has important wisdom to impart, backed by his own common sense, some science, and some philosophy, about how to deal with the insults we are likely to get, and inclined to give." -- John Perry, Distinguished Professor of Philosophy, University of California at Riverside and Henry Waldgrave Stuart Professor of Philosophy Emeritus, Stanford University <br><p></p><br>"Essential reading in our age of rage." --<em>The Lady</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Handbook of Research Methods in Migration (Elgar Original Reference)</h2><p>Covering both qualitative and quantitative topics, the expert contributors in this <i>Handbook</i> explore fundamental issues of scientific logic, methodology and methods, through to practical applications of different techniques and approaches in migration research. <p>The chapters of this interdisciplinary <i>Handbook</i> maintain an introductory level of discussion on migration research methods, while providing readers with references necessary for those wishing to go deeper into the topic.

Erdal, International Migration Review</p><h2>Being Given: Toward a Phenomenology of Givenness (Cultural Memory in the Present)</h2><p>Along with Husserl's <i>Ideas</i> and Heidegger's <i>Being and Time</i>, <i>Being Given</i> is one of the classic works of phenomenology in the twentieth century. Through readings of Kant, Husserl, Heidegger, Derrida, and twentieth-century French phenomenology (e.g., Merleau-Ponty, Levinas, and Henry), it ventures a bold and decisive reappraisal of phenomenology and its possibilities. Its author's most original work to date, the book pushes phenomenology to its limits in an attempt to redefine and recover the phenomenological ideal, which the author argues has never been realized in any of the historical phenomenologies. Against Husserl's reduction to consciousness and Heidegger's reduction to <i>Dasein</i>, the author proposes a third reduction to givenness, wherein phenomena appear unconditionally and show themselves from themselves at their own initiative. <i>Being Given</i> is the clearest, most systematic response to questions that have occupied its author for the better part of two decades. The book articulates a powerful set of concepts that should provoke new research in philosophy, religion, and art, as well as at the intersection of these disciplines. Some of the significant issues it treats include the phenomenological definition of the phenomenon, the redefinition of the gift in terms not of economy but of givenness, the nature of saturated phenomena, and the question "Who comes after the subject?" Throughout his consideration of these issues, the author carefully notes their significance for the increasingly popular fields of religious studies and philosophy of religion. <i>Being Given</i> is therefore indispensable reading for anyone interested in the question of the relation between the phenomenological and the theological in Marion and emergent French phenomenology.</p><p>&#x201c;Jean-Luc Marion has established himself as the leading phenomenologist of the day. The appearance of Being Given, the English translation of what is in my view the most important philosophical work of this important thinker, marks a milestone in the reception of Marion's work in English. A brilliant, complex and meticulous analysis of the whole range of phenomena surrounding giving, givenness, and the gift, culminating in the saturated phenomenon as the &#x2018;given par excellence,&#x2019; Being Given, which was ten years in the making, will be the standard work in this field for an entire generation. Kosky's translation is superb. Altogether, a major publishing event.&#x201d;&#x2014;John D. Caputo, Villanova University<br>&#x201c;Audacious and rigorous, Being Given is a signal contribution to modern thought. For Marion, phenomenology is concerned not with objects or even being but with givenness. Having clarified what phenomenology does, Marion brilliantly shows how it exceeds metaphysics and how it requires us to rethink the human subject in the most radical manner. At no time are we asked to call on revelation, yet every page of this luminous book has rich and inescapable implications for theology as well as philosophy.&#x201d;&#x2014;Kevin Hart, Monash UniversityJean-Luc Marion is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Paris, Sorbonne. He has also taught and lectured for more than fifteen years at various universities in the United States, notably at the University of Chicago. Among his books published in English translation are <i>God Without Being</i> and <i>Reduction and Givenness: Investigations of Husserl, Heidegger, and Phenomenology.</i></p><h2>The Complete Aromatherapy and Essential Oils Handbook for Everyday Wellness</h2><p><p> Aromatherapy is a method of employing essential oils to protect, heal and beautify. </p><p> Essential oils are described as the "life force" or "essence" of plants. The most wonderful thing about essential oils is that they are available to everyone, and they are very simple to use once the basic concepts are understood and the appropriate methods and procedures are observed. </p><p> The best known way to use essential oils is through massage. In this comprehensive book there are many, many more ways to use the oils for everything from arthritis and asthma to high blood pressure and constipation. Essential oils are now emerging as scientifically proven and accepted remedies for a variety of common conditions. The why and how certain oils heal still remains somewhat mysterious. Oils can help to treat everyday ailments, whether it be strengthening the immune system, fighting bacteria and viruses, and lowering stress levels to toning, relaxing and strengthening muscles. These oils help the body heal itself. </p><p> This book features 109 oils and 450 remedies. The recipes are easy to follow, do not take a long time to make, and are quite inexpensive -- the biggest cost is the oils. The oils are organized in an A to Z format, and each entry features the botanical name, a full description of how and why the oil is extracted as well as its therapeutic uses. </p><p> Angelica for example has a sweet, rich smell, is excellent in all skin care preparations both as a tonic and to soften and smooth rough, dry skin. It reduces inflammation and can be useful when applied to irritated skin. As a massage oil it purifies the body and acts as a lymphatic stimulator, draining the body of excess fluid, increasing energy and generally quickening the functioning of glands. It's also an excellent tonic for the entire digestive system as it strengthens the liver, stimulates appetite, aids digestion and generally boosts the whole digestive system. </p><p> Nerys Purchon was one of Australia's leading experts on herbs, aromatherapy and essential oils. Her books have sold more than 300,000 copies worldwide. </p></p><p><p> Lora Cantele, RA, CMAIA, AAS is a Registered Aromatherapist, Clinical Aromatologist, Certified Swiss Reflex Therapist, and Aromatherapy Educator and writer.

His book is a meticulous, expertly crafted entity that gathers strength from strength as it goes along toward its dramatic denouement, its length adding to the cumulative passion and moral importance of the whole work. This is a momentous achievement. Enthralling!<p>In this detailed biography, Frederick Brown discloses Zola's development as an author, and the moral consciousness that led him to invest himself in one social and political problem after another.

Love isn&#39;t always at first sight. When Elizabeth Bennet meets Mr Darcy, it&#39;s fair to say he doesn&#39;t make the best first impression. Arrogant, condescending and aloof, he is everything the spirited and clever Elizbeth despises - and that&#39;s before he breaks her sister&#39;s heart. But why, then, do her thoughts turn to him again and again? Slowly, Elizabeth starts to realise that her first impression may have been wrong. But by then, it might just be too late!</p><p><i>"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."</i><p> Next to the exhortation at the beginning of <i>Moby-Dick</i>, "Call me Ishmael," the first sentence of Jane Austen's <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> must be among the most quoted in literature. And certainly what Melville did for whaling Austen does for marriage--tracing the intricacies (not to mention the economics) of 19th-century British mating rituals with a sure hand and an unblinking eye. As usual, Austen trains her sights on a country village and a few families--in this case, the Bennets, the Philips, and the Lucases. Into their midst comes Mr. Bingley, a single man of good fortune, and his friend, Mr. Darcy, who is even richer. Mrs. Bennet, who married above her station, sees their arrival as an opportunity to marry off at least one of her five daughters. Bingley is complaisant and easily charmed by the eldest Bennet girl, Jane; Darcy, however, is harder to please. Put off by Mrs. Bennet's vulgarity and the untoward behavior of the three younger daughters, he is unable to see the true worth of the older girls, Jane and Elizabeth. His excessive pride offends Lizzy, who is more than willing to believe the worst that other people have to say of him; when George Wickham, a soldier stationed in the village, does indeed have a discreditable tale to tell, his words fall on fertile ground. </p><p> Having set up the central misunderstanding of the novel, Austen then brings in her cast of fascinating secondary characters: Mr. Collins, the sycophantic clergyman who aspires to Lizzy's hand but settles for her best friend, Charlotte, instead; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Darcy's insufferably snobbish aunt; and the Gardiners, Jane and Elizabeth's low-born but noble-hearted aunt and uncle. Some of Austen's best comedy comes from mixing and matching these representatives of different classes and economic strata, demonstrating the hypocrisy at the heart of so many social interactions. And though the novel is rife with romantic misunderstandings, rejected proposals, disastrous elopements, and a requisite happy ending for those who deserve one, Austen never gets so carried away with the romance that she loses sight of the hard economic realities of 19th-century matrimonial maneuvering. Good marriages for penniless girls such as the Bennets are hard to come by, and even Lizzy, who comes to sincerely value Mr. Darcy, remarks when asked when she first began to love him: "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley." She may be joking, but there's more than a little truth to her sentiment, as well. Jane Austen considered Elizabeth Bennet "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print". Readers of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> would be hard-pressed to disagree. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

With amusing detail and historical anecdote, Alfred Crosby discusses the shift from qualitative to quantitative perception that occurred during the late Middle Ages and Renaissance. Alfred W. Crosby is the author of five books, including the award-winning Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900 (Cambridge, 1986)</p><p><i>The Measure of Reality</i> is the third book in a series in which Alfred Crosby, a noted historian, asks how it is that Western European societies could have conquered so much of the world in the space of a few generations. The answer, he finds, is in certain agricultural and technological techniques. In this volume he turns to one set of techniques in particular: the precise measurement of time, number, and distance. That precise measurement enabled European armies to march in step, enabled navigators to find faraway ports, and enabled gunsmiths and chemists to formulate the weapons of conquest. These inventions were refined over centuries, but most came heavily into play in the years between 1250 and 1300, the period Crosby examines in closest detail. <i>The Measure of Reality</i> offers a fascinating, big-picture view of the artifacts that changed history.Western Europeans were among the first, if not the first, to invent mechanical clocks, geometrically precise maps, double-entry bookkeeping, precise algebraic and musical notations, and perspective painting.

In this exciting new edition, Jeal draws on fresh sources and archival discoveries to provide the most fully rounded portrait of this complicated man&#x2014;dogged by failure throughout his life despite his full share of success.</p><p>Using Livingstone&#x2019;s original field notebooks, Jeal finds that the explorer&#x2019;s problems with his African followers were far graver than previously understood. From recently discovered letters he elaborates on the explorer&#x2019;s decision to send his wife Mary back home to England. He also uncovers fascinating information about Livingstone&#x2019;s importance to the British Empire and about his relationship with the journalist-adventurer Henry Morton Stanley. In addition Jeal here evokes the full pathos of the explorer&#x2019;s final journey.

Outer Radiance is perceived through Desire, in the World, in the opening and closing of the Doors of Yin and Yang. This is the Named, the Visible, these are the Myriad Things. Thus, both with and without Desire, we draw near to the Mystery of Mysteries, to the Gateway that leads to all Marvels, to the Tao.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> John Minford: The Tao and the Power says to its reader at the very outset, "Only through experience, only through living Life to the full, in both the Inner and Outer Worlds, can the True Nature of the Tao be Understood and communicated. Not through Words." Desire and the Life of the Senses are part of that experience. Through Desire we witness and enjoy the Beauty of the World, we Observe the Outer Radiance of the Tao. We live Life, we bask in its Radiance. Taoists do not deny the Senses. But Contemplation, the Light of Deep Calm, of meditative experience, goes further. It reveals the Inner Marvel, the Mystery of Mysteries. Outer Radiance and Inner Marvel issue from one and the same Source, which is the Tao. This twofold path is one of the central themes in Magister Liu's commentary, one to which he returns again and again, exhorting the Taoist Aspirant to begin from Observation of the Outer Radiance, and to proceed through Contemplation of the Inner Marvel to a deeper level of Self-Cultivation, to a deeper Attainment of the Tao. "It is Contemplation that gives spiritual significance to objects of sense."<br> &nbsp;<br> The Book of Taoist Master Zhuang: The Great Tao cannot be Told. The Great Discussion lies beyond Words . . . Where can I find someone who Understands this Discussion beyond Words, who Understands the Tao that can never be Told? This True Understanding of the Tao is a Reservoir of Heaven-and-Nature. Pour into it and it is never full. Pour from it and it is never exhausted. It is impossible to know whence it comes. It is Inner Light.<br> &nbsp;<br> Arthur Waley: Not only are Books the mere discarded husk or shell of wisdom, but Words themselves, expressing as they do only such things as belong to the normal state of consciousness, are irrelevant to the deeper experience of the Tao, the "wordless doctrine."<br> &nbsp;<br> Jan Duyvendak: The ordinary, mundane Tao (the one that can be easily Told, or talked about) is unchanging, static, and permanent. The True Tao is Elusive and Ineffable, is in its very Essence Perpetual Change. In the Tao, nothing whatsoever is fixed and unchanging. This is the first great paradox of this Classic, the ever-shifting Cycle of Change, of Being and Non-Being, in which Life and Death constantly yield to and alternate with each other.<br> &nbsp;<br> Richard Wilhelm: In the Taoist Heart-and-Mind, Psyche and Cosmos are related to each other like the Inner and Outer Worlds.<br> &nbsp;<br> JM: A Tao that could be Told might be any one of the Prescriptions for Living and Ruling that were being proposed in the ferment of the Chinese Warring States period (475-221 BC). All of them would have been called a Tao, a Way, a Recipe for Life. One such Tao, for example, was contained in the little book from that period known as The Art of War (Sunzi bingfa), whose "author," Sun-tzu (Sunzi), is every bit as lost in the mists of legend as Lao-tzu (Laozi). The Deep Tao, the True Way, and the inexhaustible Inner Power or Strength that flows from the experience of the Tao, are the subjects of this whole Five Thousand Word text. But they are beyond Telling. Words and Names are nothing more than disjointed bits and pieces; they fragment the whole, the One Tao. The paradoxical Mystery of Mysteries is that the Taoist fuses Being on the one hand (the Radiance, Magnificence, and Beauty of the Outer World, as perceived through the Senses, through Desire), and Non-Being on the other (the Dark Intangible Marvel and Mystery of the Inner World). This fusion, this Gateway to Marvels, does not lend itself to any simplistic Name or Label. Names were the preoccupation of more worldly schools of thought, especially the Confucians, for whom Names needed to correspond precisely to Things. As with so much of this short and densely ambiguous Classic, the Chinese word used here for Name, ming, has more than one meaning. It also means Fame, Renown, or Reputation (it is after all by being Famous that one acquires a "Name" for oneself). Taoists care nothing for Fame. They hide their Light. They are incognito. And yet, despite these protestations about the vanity of Words and Names, and the powerlessness of Words to describe the True Nature of the Tao, despite the futility of even attempting to define or dissect the Tao, paradoxically, The Tao and the Power itself is written in an intensely poetic language (sometimes mesmerizingly and bafflingly so), which edges imperceptibly toward the Wordless Truth, it is an inaudible Song with neither Words nor Music, it sings the Silence that is the Tao. The Tao needs to be experienced, not talked about. This Classic and its countless Commentaries do talk, they propose all manner of Images (see the Taoist Florilegium appended at the end of my translation for a selection of these). But these are merely pointers toward the Tao, toward the gnosis of Taoist experience, parts of a hermetic vocabulary for initiates. In that sense these Names are No-Names.<br> &nbsp;<br> Arthur Waley, whose translation from the 1930s remains one of the best, gives us a pithy summary of this first Chapter and of the whole book. "In dispassionate Vision the Taoist sees a world consisting of the things for which language has no Name. We can call it the Sameness or the Mystery. These Names are however merely stopgaps. For what we are trying to express is Darker than any Mystery."<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The Tang dynasty poet Bo Juyi (772-846) jested:<br> &nbsp;<br> Those who speak<br> &nbsp;<br> Know nothing;<br> &nbsp;<br> Those who Know<br> &nbsp;<br> Are silent.<br> &nbsp;<br> Those Words, I'm told,<br> &nbsp;<br> Were uttered<br> &nbsp;<br> By Lao-tzu.<br> &nbsp;<br> If we're to believe<br> &nbsp;<br> That he himself<br> &nbsp;<br> Was someone who Knew,<br> &nbsp;<br> Why did he end up<br> &nbsp;<br> Writing a Book<br> &nbsp;<br> Of Five Thousand Words?<br> &nbsp;<br> 2<br> &nbsp;<br> A Wordless Teaching<br> &nbsp;<br> That which All-under-Heaven<br> &nbsp;<br> Considers<br> &nbsp;<br> Beautiful<br> &nbsp;<br> May also be considered<br> &nbsp;<br> Ugly;<br> &nbsp;<br> That which All-under-Heaven<br> &nbsp;<br> Considers<br> &nbsp;<br> Good<br> &nbsp;<br> May also be considered<br> &nbsp;<br> Not-Good.<br> &nbsp;<br> Being and Non-Being<br> &nbsp;<br> Engender one another.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hard and Easy<br> &nbsp;<br> Complete each other.<br> &nbsp;<br> Long and Short<br> &nbsp;<br> Generate each other.<br> &nbsp;<br> High and Low<br> &nbsp;<br> Complement each other.<br> &nbsp;<br> Melody and Harmony<br> &nbsp;<br> Resonate with each other.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fore and Aft<br> &nbsp;<br> Follow one another.<br> &nbsp;<br> These are Constant Truths.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Taoist dwells in<br> &nbsp;<br> Non-Action,<br> &nbsp;<br> Practices<br> &nbsp;<br> A Wordless Teaching.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Myriad Things arise,<br> &nbsp;<br> And none are rejected.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Tao gives Birth<br> &nbsp;<br> But never Possesses.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Taoist Acts<br> &nbsp;<br> Without Attachment,<br> &nbsp;<br> Achieves<br> &nbsp;<br> Without dwelling<br> &nbsp;<br> On Achievement,<br> &nbsp;<br> And so never loses.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The River Master<br> &nbsp;<br> The Taoist rules through Non-Action, through the Tao.

Whosoever goes beyond False Knowledge is freed from "opposites" such as Beautiful and Ugly, High and Low. From this Higher Knowledge flows a Life without Possession or Attachment. The Heart-and-Mind of Opposition (such as that between Beautiful and Ugly) brings a Diminution of Life-Essence, a loss of Spirit, a confusion of Emotion. All of these damage Life. The Taoist abides in Non-Action. Freed from all such distinctions, which melt away in the Taoist Heart-and-Mind, the Taoist Returns to Non-Action, to the Wordlessness that leaves no trace.<br> &nbsp;<br> White is contained<br> &nbsp;<br> Within Black,<br> &nbsp;<br> Light shines<br> &nbsp;<br> In an Empty Room.<br> &nbsp;<br> This is the Taoist Vision.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Taoist finds Joy<br> &nbsp;<br> In unalloyed<br> &nbsp;<br> Serenity and Calm.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The Book of Taoist Master Zhuang: Every That is also a This, every This is also a That.

Affirmation creates Denial, Denial creates Affirmation. Right creates Wrong, Wrong creates Right. The Taoist's This is also a That, the Taoist's That is also a This.<br> &nbsp;<br> Waley: The first great principle of Taoism is the relativity of all attributes. Nothing in itself is either long or short. If we call a thing long, we merely mean longer than something else that we take as a standard. What we take as our standard depends on what we are used to . . . All antinomies, not merely high and low, long and short, but Life and Death themselves, merge in the Taoist identity of opposites.

Outer Radiance is perceived through Desire, in the World, in the opening and closing of the Doors of Yin and Yang. This is the Named, the Visible, these are the Myriad Things. Thus, both with and without Desire, we draw near to the Mystery of Mysteries, to the Gateway that leads to all Marvels, to the Tao.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> John Minford: The Tao and the Power says to its reader at the very outset, "Only through experience, only through living Life to the full, in both the Inner and Outer Worlds, can the True Nature of the Tao be Understood and communicated. Not through Words." Desire and the Life of the Senses are part of that experience. Through Desire we witness and enjoy the Beauty of the World, we Observe the Outer Radiance of the Tao. We live Life, we bask in its Radiance. Taoists do not deny the Senses. But Contemplation, the Light of Deep Calm, of meditative experience, goes further. It reveals the Inner Marvel, the Mystery of Mysteries. Outer Radiance and Inner Marvel issue from one and the same Source, which is the Tao. This twofold path is one of the central themes in Magister Liu's commentary, one to which he returns again and again, exhorting the Taoist Aspirant to begin from Observation of the Outer Radiance, and to proceed through Contemplation of the Inner Marvel to a deeper level of Self-Cultivation, to a deeper Attainment of the Tao. "It is Contemplation that gives spiritual significance to objects of sense."<br> &nbsp;<br> The Book of Taoist Master Zhuang: The Great Tao cannot be Told. The Great Discussion lies beyond Words . . . Where can I find someone who Understands this Discussion beyond Words, who Understands the Tao that can never be Told? This True Understanding of the Tao is a Reservoir of Heaven-and-Nature. Pour into it and it is never full. Pour from it and it is never exhausted. It is impossible to know whence it comes. It is Inner Light.<br> &nbsp;<br> Arthur Waley: Not only are Books the mere discarded husk or shell of wisdom, but Words themselves, expressing as they do only such things as belong to the normal state of consciousness, are irrelevant to the deeper experience of the Tao, the "wordless doctrine."<br> &nbsp;<br> Jan Duyvendak: The ordinary, mundane Tao (the one that can be easily Told, or talked about) is unchanging, static, and permanent. The True Tao is Elusive and Ineffable, is in its very Essence Perpetual Change. In the Tao, nothing whatsoever is fixed and unchanging. This is the first great paradox of this Classic, the ever-shifting Cycle of Change, of Being and Non-Being, in which Life and Death constantly yield to and alternate with each other.<br> &nbsp;<br> Richard Wilhelm: In the Taoist Heart-and-Mind, Psyche and Cosmos are related to each other like the Inner and Outer Worlds.<br> &nbsp;<br> JM: A Tao that could be Told might be any one of the Prescriptions for Living and Ruling that were being proposed in the ferment of the Chinese Warring States period (475-221 BC). All of them would have been called a Tao, a Way, a Recipe for Life. One such Tao, for example, was contained in the little book from that period known as The Art of War (Sunzi bingfa), whose "author," Sun-tzu (Sunzi), is every bit as lost in the mists of legend as Lao-tzu (Laozi). The Deep Tao, the True Way, and the inexhaustible Inner Power or Strength that flows from the experience of the Tao, are the subjects of this whole Five Thousand Word text. But they are beyond Telling. Words and Names are nothing more than disjointed bits and pieces; they fragment the whole, the One Tao. The paradoxical Mystery of Mysteries is that the Taoist fuses Being on the one hand (the Radiance, Magnificence, and Beauty of the Outer World, as perceived through the Senses, through Desire), and Non-Being on the other (the Dark Intangible Marvel and Mystery of the Inner World). This fusion, this Gateway to Marvels, does not lend itself to any simplistic Name or Label. Names were the preoccupation of more worldly schools of thought, especially the Confucians, for whom Names needed to correspond precisely to Things. As with so much of this short and densely ambiguous Classic, the Chinese word used here for Name, ming, has more than one meaning. It also means Fame, Renown, or Reputation (it is after all by being Famous that one acquires a "Name" for oneself). Taoists care nothing for Fame. They hide their Light. They are incognito. And yet, despite these protestations about the vanity of Words and Names, and the powerlessness of Words to describe the True Nature of the Tao, despite the futility of even attempting to define or dissect the Tao, paradoxically, The Tao and the Power itself is written in an intensely poetic language (sometimes mesmerizingly and bafflingly so), which edges imperceptibly toward the Wordless Truth, it is an inaudible Song with neither Words nor Music, it sings the Silence that is the Tao. The Tao needs to be experienced, not talked about. This Classic and its countless Commentaries do talk, they propose all manner of Images (see the Taoist Florilegium appended at the end of my translation for a selection of these). But these are merely pointers toward the Tao, toward the gnosis of Taoist experience, parts of a hermetic vocabulary for initiates. In that sense these Names are No-Names.<br> &nbsp;<br> Arthur Waley, whose translation from the 1930s remains one of the best, gives us a pithy summary of this first Chapter and of the whole book. "In dispassionate Vision the Taoist sees a world consisting of the things for which language has no Name. We can call it the Sameness or the Mystery. These Names are however merely stopgaps. For what we are trying to express is Darker than any Mystery."<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The Tang dynasty poet Bo Juyi (772-846) jested:<br> &nbsp;<br> Those who speak<br> &nbsp;<br> Know nothing;<br> &nbsp;<br> Those who Know<br> &nbsp;<br> Are silent.<br> &nbsp;<br> Those Words, I'm told,<br> &nbsp;<br> Were uttered<br> &nbsp;<br> By Lao-tzu.<br> &nbsp;<br> If we're to believe<br> &nbsp;<br> That he himself<br> &nbsp;<br> Was someone who Knew,<br> &nbsp;<br> Why did he end up<br> &nbsp;<br> Writing a Book<br> &nbsp;<br> Of Five Thousand Words?<br> &nbsp;<br> 2<br> &nbsp;<br> A Wordless Teaching<br> &nbsp;<br> That which All-under-Heaven<br> &nbsp;<br> Considers<br> &nbsp;<br> Beautiful<br> &nbsp;<br> May also be considered<br> &nbsp;<br> Ugly;<br> &nbsp;<br> That which All-under-Heaven<br> &nbsp;<br> Considers<br> &nbsp;<br> Good<br> &nbsp;<br> May also be considered<br> &nbsp;<br> Not-Good.<br> &nbsp;<br> Being and Non-Being<br> &nbsp;<br> Engender one another.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hard and Easy<br> &nbsp;<br> Complete each other.<br> &nbsp;<br> Long and Short<br> &nbsp;<br> Generate each other.<br> &nbsp;<br> High and Low<br> &nbsp;<br> Complement each other.<br> &nbsp;<br> Melody and Harmony<br> &nbsp;<br> Resonate with each other.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fore and Aft<br> &nbsp;<br> Follow one another.<br> &nbsp;<br> These are Constant Truths.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Taoist dwells in<br> &nbsp;<br> Non-Action,<br> &nbsp;<br> Practices<br> &nbsp;<br> A Wordless Teaching.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Myriad Things arise,<br> &nbsp;<br> And none are rejected.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Tao gives Birth<br> &nbsp;<br> But never Possesses.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Taoist Acts<br> &nbsp;<br> Without Attachment,<br> &nbsp;<br> Achieves<br> &nbsp;<br> Without dwelling<br> &nbsp;<br> On Achievement,<br> &nbsp;<br> And so never loses.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The River Master<br> &nbsp;<br> The Taoist rules through Non-Action, through the Tao.

Whosoever goes beyond False Knowledge is freed from "opposites" such as Beautiful and Ugly, High and Low. From this Higher Knowledge flows a Life without Possession or Attachment. The Heart-and-Mind of Opposition (such as that between Beautiful and Ugly) brings a Diminution of Life-Essence, a loss of Spirit, a confusion of Emotion. All of these damage Life. The Taoist abides in Non-Action. Freed from all such distinctions, which melt away in the Taoist Heart-and-Mind, the Taoist Returns to Non-Action, to the Wordlessness that leaves no trace.<br> &nbsp;<br> White is contained<br> &nbsp;<br> Within Black,<br> &nbsp;<br> Light shines<br> &nbsp;<br> In an Empty Room.<br> &nbsp;<br> This is the Taoist Vision.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Taoist finds Joy<br> &nbsp;<br> In unalloyed<br> &nbsp;<br> Serenity and Calm.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The Book of Taoist Master Zhuang: Every That is also a This, every This is also a That.

Nothing in itself is either long or short. If we call a thing long, we merely mean longer than something else that we take as a standard. What we take as our standard depends on what we are used to . . . All antinomies, not merely high and low, long and short, but Life and Death themselves, merge in the Taoist identity of opposites.

During the Third Reich, German Protestant theologians, motivated by racism and tapping into traditional Christian anti-Semitism, redefined Jesus as an Aryan and Christianity as a religion at war with Judaism. In 1939, these theologians established the Institute for the Study and Eradication of Jewish Influence on German Religious Life. In <i>The Aryan Jesus</i>, Susannah Heschel shows that during the Third Reich, the Institute became the most important propaganda organ of German Protestantism, exerting a widespread influence and producing a nazified Christianity that placed anti-Semitism at its theological center.</p><br><p> Based on years of archival research, <i>The Aryan Jesus</i> examines the membership and activities of this controversial theological organization. With headquarters in Eisenach, the Institute sponsored propaganda conferences throughout the Nazi Reich and published books defaming Judaism, including a dejudaized version of the New Testament and a catechism proclaiming Jesus as the savior of the Aryans. Institute members--professors of theology, bishops, and pastors--viewed their efforts as a vital support for Hitler's war against the Jews. Heschel looks in particular at Walter Grundmann, the Institute's director and a professor of the New Testament at the University of Jena. Grundmann and his colleagues formed a community of like-minded Nazi Christians who remained active and continued to support each other in Germany's postwar years.</p><br><br><p> <i>The Aryan Jesus</i> raises vital questions about Christianity's recent past and the ambivalent place of Judaism in Christian thought.</p></p><p><p>"Susannah Heschel's <i>The Aryan Jesus</i> is a brilliant and erudite investigation of the convergence between major trends in German Protestantism and Nazi racial anti-Semitism.

This blanced and highly successful collaboration of scholars with a theater director solves the contemporary problems of translating and staging the <i>Orestia,</i> which originally was written to be performed in Athens in the first half of the fifth century B.C.&nbsp;While remaning faithful to the original Greek, Grene and O'Flaherty embrace a strong and adventurous English style, vivid and visceral. The language of this extraordinary translation, immediately accessible to a theater audience, speaks across the centuries. Premiered at Chicago's Court Theater in 1986 under Rudall's direction, the stage adaptation of the <i>Orestia</i> proved eminently playable. &nbsp;This new adaptation of the orestia offers a brilliant demonstration of how clearly defined goals (here, the actor's needs) can inspire translators to produce fresh, genuine, accessible dramatic texts. The resulting work provides complete and accurate texts for those who cannot read the original Greek, and it transforms the <i>Orestia</i> into an effective modern stage play. With interpretive introductions written by the translators and director, this new version will be welcomed by teachers of translation courses, by students of Greek and world drama in general, and by theater professionals.</p><p>This new version of the Oresteia, with interpretive introductions written by the translators and director, will be welcome by teachers of translation courses and director, will be welcomed by teachers of translation courses, by students of Greek and world drama in general.Text: English, Greek (translation)</p><h2>Little Women: A Novel</h2><p><b>The perfect holiday read and just in time for the major feature film, a timeless new edition of one of the most beloved novels of all time.</b><br><br><i>Little Women</i> is recognized as one of the best-loved classic children's stories, transcending the boundaries of time and age, making it as popular with adults as it is with young readers.

This stirring fable captures a new spirit of Christianity--where personal, daily interaction with God is more important than institutional church structures, where faith is more about a way of life than a system of belief, where being authentically good is more important than being doctrinally "right," and where one's direction is more important than one's present location.

After many years as a church planter and pastor, author Brian McLaren has found-as more and more Christians are finding-that neither the conservative evangelical nor the liberal mainline stream of Christianity fully expresses his own developing faith. McLaren&#39;s engaging story gives voice to this emerging understanding of what it can mean to be a Christian in these dynamic times, offering a constructive vision of what a postmodern Christian might look like. A New Kind of Christian recounts a lively and intimate conversation between a pastor and his daughter&#39;s high school science teacher, in which they reflect together about faith, doubt, reason, mission, leadership, and spiritual practice in the emerging postmodern world. The pastor is forced to grapple with the deeper source of his dissatisfaction with Christianity as he has understood, practiced, and taught it -his reluctance to let go of the &#34;modern model&#34; of Christianity. Ultimately, he comes to understand that beyond the constricted categories, cliched rhetoric, and rigid mechanisms of modern Christianity lies a new possibility: a revitalized and vibrant faith that explores and expresses the teachings and mission of Jesus in a fresh, engaging way for third-millennium people. The author reminds us that this is but the beginning of the journey, and &#34;whatever a new kind of Christian is, no one is one yet. . . . But every transformation has to start somewhere.&#34; For all who are searching for a deeper life with God and a more honest statement ofauthentic Christian faith, A New Kind of Christian will open the way for an exciting spiritual adventure into new territory and new ways of believing, belonging, and becoming.

It argues that the character of the political changes (dispersed sovereignty, local autonomy) prevented both a general reformation of the Church before 1520 and a national reformation thereafter. The resulting settlement maintained the public peace through politically structured religious communities (confessions), thereby avoiding further religious strife and fixing the confessions into the Empire&#39;s constitution. The Germans&#39; emergence into the modern era as a people having two national religions was the reformation&#39;s principal legacy to modern Germany.</p><p>This book studies the connections between the political reform of the Holy Roman Empire and the German lands around 1500 and the sixteenth-century religious reformations. It argues that the character of the political changes blocked both a general reformation of the Church before 1520 and a national reformation thereafter, resulting in an arrangement that maintained the public peace through politically structured religious communities.Thomas A.

Nesbit understood that the stories are the least part of Shakespeare, but as a mother she also understood the need for simplicity. Envisioning this simplified introduction to works such as The Winter&#39;s Tale, Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream and The Taming of the Shrew -- eleven plays in all -- E. Nesbit set out to make them more accessible to young readers without sacrificing any essential elements. For if the stories were stripped of their wit and humor, of their emotion, the children would be no more entertained by them than by the indecipherable originals. In the end, under E. Nesbit&#39;s gifted pen, these stories emerge with all the charm and grace of the very best fairy tales. Written in thoroughly modern English and each no more than ten pages in length, the eleven plays featured in this volume afford children the opportunity to discover for themselves the magic of Shakespeare.</p><p><p>E. Nesbit 1858-1924, was an English author and poet, who wrote or collaborated on more than 60 works of fiction for children, several of which have been adapted for film and television and are still popular today, such as The Treasure Seekers and Five Children and It.</p><p>English author Edith Nesbit's impressive body of work includes poems, plays, novels, and even ghost stories, however, she is best known for her beloved children's adventure stories, published under the name E. Nesbit. Among Nesbit's best-known works are The Story of the Treasure-Seekers, The Railway Children, The Wouldbegoods and Five Children and It. Nesbit's novels departed from the children's literary tradition of fantasy-worlds popularized by Lewis Carroll and Kenneth Grahame, and instead focused on the adventures to be had from real-life experiences. Nesbit's work inspired other writers like C. S. Lewis, P. L Travers, and J. K. Rowling, and many of her stories have been adapted for film and television. In addition to writing, Nesbit was an activist and co-founded the Fabian Society, a socialist group that provided the foundation for the modern British Labour Party. Nesbit died in 1924.</p>Any attempt to introduce the beauty of Shakespeare to young people should be applauded.

He is also a prize-winning poet. Since he was first enthralled by the mysterious power of poetry, he has been a dedicated student. In fact, for him, poetry has been nothing less than the occupation of his lifetime, and in this book he presents a distillation of all he&#x2019;s learned about the art form that matters to him most.</p><p>With his customary wit, delightfully lucid prose style and wide-ranging knowledge, Clive James explains the difference between the innocuous stuff so prevalent today and a real poem: the latter being a work of unity that insists on being heard entire and threatens never to leave the memory. A committed formalist and an astute commentator, James examines the poems and legacies of a panorama of twentieth-century poets, from&nbsp;Hart Crane to Ezra Pound, from Ted Hughes to Anne Sexton. In some cases he includes second readings or rereadings from later in life&#x2015;just to be sure he wasn&#x2019;t wrong the first time! Whether demanding that poetry must be heard beyond the world of poetry or opining on his five favorite poets (Yeats, Frost, Auden, Wilbur, and Larkin), James captures the whole truth of life's transience in this unforgettably eloquent book on how to read and appreciate modern poetry.</p></p><p><strong>Clive James</strong> (1939&#x2015;2019), author of the best-selling <em>Cultural Amnesia</em> and <em>Poetry Notebook</em>, was an Officer of the Order of Australia and a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. His writing appeared in the <em>New York Times Book Review</em>, <em>The New Yorker</em>, and <em>The Atlantic</em>.&#x201c;This ability to tell which lines live and which only counterfeit life&#x2015;call it, simply, taste&#x2015;is Mr. James&#x2019;s great strength as a critic of poetry. His focus on the phrase and the line, rather than the large structure or the governing thought, feels like a poet&#x2019;s way of reading.... Mr. James&#x2019;s generosity of attention, his willingness to trawl through pages of verse in search of the hair-raising line, is his most appealing quality as a critic.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Adam Kirsch, <em>Wall Street Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Clive James's&nbsp;<em>Poetry Notebook</em>&nbsp;reintroduced me to the intense pleasures of close reading. Although he has some hard&#x2015;and funny&#x2015;things to say about Ezra Pound, James is firmly committed to celebration. He reminds us that poetry is, or can be, 'the most exciting thing in the world.' And this is what literary criticism, and literary pedagogy, should aim for: not to add a further encrustation of complexity, but simply to instill the readerly habits of gratitude and awe.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Martin Amis</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Clive James has a fantastic range and depth of knowledge. He is, at times, miraculously funny. He writes knowledgeably and with passion about literature, and especially poetry.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Sam Leith, <em>Spectator</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The James voice is immediately recognisable. To describe it as comic does not do it justice: it might be fairer to say that the world it inhabits is prone, at most times, to a comedy of desperate sorts...James's best comedy is in the phrase-making, a craft at which he excels...James was &#x2015;and remains&#x2015;far more than a clever boy laughing at muddied oafs. He is a scholar who has preferred wearing his scholarship lightly.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>George Szirtes, <em>New Statesman</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;As a critic, James is formidable, blending vast reading with the knowledge of practice. He demurs from having an 'aesthetic system,' but this is too modest. There are some clear positions in <em>Poetry Notebook</em>, and they are erudite, strident, but balanced...<em>Poetry Notebook</em> is a stellar collection by a great Australian writer, a man who, '[l]ooking back...with tired eyes,' retains the poetic enthusiasm of his teenage self.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>James McNamara, <em>The Australian</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[Clive James] is a unique figure, a straddler of genres and a bridger of the gaps between high and low culture. He will be seen, I think, as one of the most important and influential writers of our time.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Bryan Appleyard, <em>Sunday Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This collection of &#x2018;miniature essays&#x2019; on poetry... informs and delights....&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly, Starred review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[<em>Poetry Notebook</em> is] compact and entertaining... James is still with us and, on virtually every page of <em>Poetry Notebook</em>, shedding sparks. Readers who make the mistake of finding his taste for canonical poems &#x2018;conservative&#x2019; should still get a charge from his bloody-minded drive... A breathtaking book by an old master running out of breaths.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jason Guriel, <em>The New Republic</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A rousing compendium of short essays about poetry and poets that James has published over the years.... What you will find in <em>Poetry Notebook</em> are charged, idiosyncratic readings of the classics as well as more recent works.... I defy anyone not to be moved by these essays in which a great critic reflects on the works that have shaped him, even as, James says, he prepares himself to head off to &#x2018;the empty regions.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Maureen Corrigan, <em>NPR</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[James] writes with enthusiasm about his favorites&#x2015;Yeats, Frost, Auden, Wilbur, Larkin.... Here, too, are takes on some fine poets who aren't household names: Louis MacNeice, Les Murray, Michael Longley and Stephen Edgar....

One of the great playwrights of his age, second only to Shakespeare, he was also a secret agent as well as the central figure in a murder mystery. Now, Park Honan offers the most thoroughly researched and detailed biography of Marlowe to appear in over fifty years. <br> Honan, the acclaimed biographer of Shakespeare, takes us from Marlowe's childhood in Canterbury to his mysterious death in Deptford, shedding much light on this shadowy individual. The book features new information on Marlowe's six-and-a-half years at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, his shocking blasphemy and his street fights, his methods of preparing himself for writing, and his alleged atheism. The book includes new facts about Marlowe's adventures on the continent, where he was caught with a counterfeit coin, a hanging offense, but talked his way out of the noose and was returned to England in irons. Honan describes his attraction to scientists such as Thomas Harriot and other hard-headed realists bent on innovation and free thought. In addition, there are new details on spies and business agents that Marlowe knew, a more exact account of the circumstances that led to his murder, and a fresh description of his evolving relationship with Shakespeare. <br> The author of <em>Tamberlaine the Great</em> and <em>Doctor Faustus</em>, Christopher Marlowe changed the nature of the English stage. Researched in archives in England, Europe, and the United States, this superb biography paints an unforgettable portrait of one of the most remarkable figures in English literature.<br></p><p><br><strong>Park Honan</strong> is Emeritus Professor at the School of English, University of Leeds. He has written biographies of Jane Austen, Matthew Arnold, and Robert Browning. His most recent biography, <em>Shakespeare: A Life</em>, was hailed as "the best available biography" (<em>Boston Globe</em>) and "impressively researched" (<em>New York Times</em>), and <em>The Baltimore Sun</em> wrote "If you have never read a book about William Shakespeare, please read this one."<br>When it comes to the accumulation of apocryphal legend, few poets can compete with Christopher Marlowe: Scholars have long ruminated over evidence of his activities as a "spy, unceasing blasphemer, a tough street-fighter and courageous homosexual," not to mention his murder at age 29. In this well-crafted biography, Honan (Shakespeare: A Life) sheds light on the much-speculated (and previously erroneously reported) aspects of Marlowe's life without neglecting its more ordinary features (his stable two-parent upbringing, his diligent scholarship at Cambridge) or destroying the poet's aura of intrigue. Honan engages with the work of prior scholars, but draws his own conclusions, employing Cambridge University records, unpaid bills ("he still seems to have owed for lamb chops and beer"), and "suddenly acquired" documents to freshly reconstruct Marlowe's activities, which included arrests, brawls, imprisonments and his involvement in a counterfeiting operation in the Netherlands. Honan writes that "as a poet, Marlowe had interested himself in clandestine power, tricks, abasement, and immoral force," and by infusing his account with close readings of Tamburlaine, The Jew of Malta, Dr. Faustus and Hero and Leander, Honan explores the fascinating convergence of Marlowe's dual professions. Finally, revisiting the coroner's report and the facts surrounding Marlowe's final hours (he died after being stabbed in the face), Honan handles the poet's murder with the same attention to detail he brings to his life. The care and depth of this biography honor Marlowe's complexities-as Honan writes, "Our lives do not fit into the conventional genres of the stage, as he knew."<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Routledge is an imprint of Taylor &amp; Francis, an informa company.</p><p>"Crispin Sartwell has written a classic book on experiencing the world aesthetically. It is rich with real examples and personal knowledge of the way each of the six names of beauty discloses a different mode of beauty&#x2019;s meaning in human life. The book has the clarity and acuity of philosophy at its best, without jargon or dogma or the kind of heaviness that typically weighs down the discussion of what should be marvelous to think about. I enjoyed it greatly, and would recommend it as an antidote to those that believe aesthetics is marginal or minor, and a treat for those who realize that beauty is what gives value to life at its best."

He does this by looking at several strands that make up the liberal and democratic constitutional traditions, and at the historical figures who best represent these strands--among them the contractarians Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau; the utilitarians Hume, Sidgwick, and J. S. Mill; and Marx regarded as a critic of liberalism. Rawls's lectures on Bishop Joseph Butler also are included in an appendix. Constantly revised and refined over three decades, Rawls's lectures on these figures reflect his developing and changing views on the history of liberalism and democracy--as well as how he saw his own work in relation to those traditions.</p><p>With its clear and careful analyses of the doctrine of the social contract, utilitarianism, and socialism--and of their most influential proponents--this volume has a critical place in the traditions it expounds. Marked by Rawls's characteristic patience and curiosity, and scrupulously edited by his student and teaching assistant, Samuel Freeman, these lectures are a fitting final addition to his oeuvre, and to the history of political philosophy as well.</p></p><p><p>John Rawls was James Bryant Conant University Professor at Harvard University. He was recipient of the 1999 National Humanities Medal.</p><p>Samuel Freeman is Professor of Philosophy and Law, University of Pennsylvania.</p>&#x201c;After the publication of <i>A Theory of Justice</i> in 1971, Rawls (1921-2002) became the most influential moral and political philosopher in the Western world. As such, the issuing of this posthumous volume, carefully edited by [Samuel] Freeman, a former student and teaching assistant from Rawls's courses at Harvard University, is a major event.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>David Gordon</b><b>, </b><b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Rawls was a dedicated and remarkably winning teacher, deeply admired by generations of grateful Harvard University pupils. Reading <i>Lectures</i> you can see why. The tone throughout is unassuming but assured, the purpose consistently to make clear, to get into steady common view what he took to be the key issues in the grand texts that he chose to explore. There is something soothing and encouraging about being guided through the works of Hobbes and Locke, Hume and J. S. Mill, Henry Sidgwick and Bishop Butler--and even Karl Marx--in these calm and measured tones...There is much quiet pleasure to be drawn from these pages, as well as a great deal of instruction about the terms in which Rawls came to frame his own ethical conceptions and the secular liberalism he believed them to imply. Anyone seriously interested in the development of Rawls's thinking and his sense of the relations between his approach and those of major predecessors in the history of Anglophone liberalism will find the insight it provides on numerous points indispensable.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>John Dunn</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;While many contemporary philosophers have deliberately shunned the history of political philosophy as irrelevant to "doing" philosophy, Rawls shows himself to be a conscientious and painstaking reader of the great works of the philosophical tradition of which he was a part. He regarded his own work as both indebted to and as culminating the great tradition that he interprets for his readers.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Steven B. Smith</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Sun</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;John Rawls is perhaps the most influential Western political philosopher of the twentieth century. The late Harvard philosopher's 1971 <i>A Theory of Justice</i> is often credited with bestowing that title upon him. In that book he drew on the works of John Locke and Immanuel Kant, among others, to criticize utilitarian theory and defend an egalitarian version of political liberalism. This volume draws together his Harvard lectures on political philosophy and liberalism, providing his insights and interpretations of Locke and Kant, as well as Thomas Hobbes, David Hume, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and others. In these lectures Rawls reveals how he interpreted these philosophers both in light of their historical circumstances and problems they were trying to address, and also in light of contemporary political debates.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>D. Schultz</b><b>, </b><b><i>Choice</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A definitive and magnificent version of Rawls's teachings on the history of political philosophy...The distinction between the rational and the reasonable runs through these lectures, and through all of Rawls's writings. Its importance signals one essential task that political philosophy should assume even in a democratic age: democracies cannot long endure, however high-sounding the principles they profess, unless their citizens learn to love and to practice the civic virtues of fairness and open discussion that alone can make these principles a reality...<i>Lectures on the History of Political Philosophy</i> shows us a Rawls keenly aware of the historical underpinnings of his own theoretical constructions...His <i>Lectures on the History of Political Philosophy</i> complement more systematic works such as <i>A Theory of Justice</i>. They make plain how the careful analysis of the insights and the limitations of his predecessors helped him to fashion many of the elements of his own political thought...Rawls's writing is at its most powerful when he thus casts aside his contractual scaffolding and speaks directly to our political conscience. Then he impels us to see more clearly than before the moral substance of the democratic ideal.

Jonathan Israel, one of the world&#x2019;s leading historians of the Enlightenment, shows how the radical ideas of American founders such as Paine, Jefferson, Franklin, Madison, and Monroe set the pattern for democratic revolutions, movements, and constitutions in France, Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Greece, Canada, Haiti, Brazil, and Spanish America.</p><p><i>The Expanding Blaze</i> reminds us that the American Revolution was an astonishingly radical event&#x2015;and that it didn&#x2019;t end with the transformation and independence of America. Rather, the Revolution continued to reverberate in Europe and the Americas for the next three-quarters of a century. This comprehensive history of the Revolution&#x2019;s international influence traces how American efforts to implement Radical Enlightenment ideas&#x2015;including the destruction of the old regime and the promotion of democratic republicanism, self-government, and liberty&#x2015;helped drive revolutions abroad, as foreign leaders explicitly followed the American example and espoused American democratic values.</p><p>The first major new intellectual history of the age of democratic revolution in decades, <i>The Expanding Blaze</i> returns the American Revolution to its global context.</p></p><p><p>"Six decades after R. R. Palmer's epic <i>Age of the Democratic Revolution</i>, Jonathan Israel has revived and powerfully extended the argument about the world-shaking reach of the radical ideas of the American Revolution&#x2014;universal and equal rights, democratic republicanism, secular rather than religious rule, and justice for all. In a shrewd, captivating analysis of the Atlantic-wide contest between the moderate and radical elements of the Enlightenment from the American Revolution to the revolutions of 1848, Israel shows that while the lamp of radical Enlightenment ideas could be deplored, dampened, and suppressed, it was impossible for generations to extinguish what Thomas Paine called &#x2018;sparks from the altar of Seventy-six.&#x2019;"<b>--Gary B. Nash, author of <i>The Unknown American Revolution: The Unruly Birth of Democracy and the Struggle to Create America</i></b></p><p>"Jonathan Israel reveals an American Revolution radical in its philosophical inspiration, global in its impact, and universal in its conviction that the cause of America is the cause of all humankind. With a sweep that brings black emancipation, the expropriation of native populations, and revolutions on three continents into a worldwide panorama, <i>The Expanding Blaze</i> illuminates a past that we only thought we knew. This is the Revolution as America's founders and their far-flung successors experienced it."<b>--Matthew Stewart, author of <i>Nature's God: The Heretical Origins of the American Republic</i></b></p><p>"With <i>The Expanding Blaze</i>, Jonathan Israel more than makes good his claim to be the only real successor to Enlightenment historians Peter Gay and R.

In <i>Alive in the Writing</i>&#x2014;an intriguing hybrid of writing guide, biography, and literary analysis&#x2014;anthropologist and novelist Kirin Narayan introduces readers to some other sides of Chekhov: his pithy, witty observations on the writing process, his life as a writer through accounts by his friends, family, and lovers, and his venture into nonfiction through his book <i>Sakhalin Island</i>. By closely attending to the people who lived under the appalling conditions of the Russian penal colony on Sakhalin, Chekhov showed how empirical details combined with a literary flair can bring readers face to face with distant, different lives, enlarging a sense of human responsibility.<br> <br> Highlighting this balance of the empirical and the literary, Narayan calls on Chekhov to bring new energy to the writing of ethnography and creative nonfiction alike. Weaving together selections from writing by and about him with examples from other talented ethnographers and memoirists, she offers practical exercises and advice on topics such as story, theory, place, person, voice, and self. A new and lively exploration of ethnography, <i>Alive in the Writing</i> shows how the genre&#x2019;s attentive, sustained connection with the lives of others can become a powerful tool for any writer.</p> <p></p></p><p><b>Kirin Narayan</b>&nbsp;is the author of&nbsp;<i>Storytellers, Saints, and Scoundrels, Mondays on the Dark Night of the Moon,&nbsp;</i>the novel&nbsp;<i>Love, Stars, and All That</i><i>, </i>and the memoir <i>My Family and Other Saints</i>, published by the University of Chicago Press. A former Guggenheim fellow, she is professor of anthropology at the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison.&#x201c;[Kirin Narayan] has written a brief and brilliant book about what it means to be an ethnographer, and how to do it responsibly, and better.&#x201d;<br> (James Wood <i>The New Yorker</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;I was skeptical about whether the writings of a nineteenth-century Russian playwright and storyteller, inspiring as they might be, could offer much assistance in the more prosaic task of crafting academic texts. Nevertheless. . . . I decided to read on anyway. I am glad I did. Chekhov, at least in Kirin Narayan&#x2019;s deft hands, proved to be a surprisingly solid source of advice for the ethnographic writer.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; (James Staples <i>Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Narayan&#x2019;s short book can easily be read as a manual, and some (especially those with less experience to assure them that the doldrums do eventually pass) will find it useful for precisely that purpose. But it is much more than that. Narayan&#x2019;s excitement at meeting Chekhov across the literature-ethnography divide and the rich array of beautiful ethnographic writing together forcefully remind us that ethnographic writing is never simply a descriptive exercise. As I read through the book, I was repeatedly struck by the sense of familiarity both with the dilemmas faced by Narayan&#x2019;s chosen authors and with the exuberant outbursts with which they leaped across the constraints of a scholarly discipline to recapture the insights of fieldwork. If a doctoral student will find practical guidance and encouragement here, for a seasoned ethnographic writer the relief comes in the realization that there is company in those seemingly lonely moments when one struggles to render into comprehensible prose the powerful presence in all fieldwork of the inchoate, the imponderable, and&#x2014;what is sometimes the result of ethical concerns for the protection of one&#x2019;s informants&#x2014;the unsayable.&#x201d; (Michael Herzfeld <i>American Anthropologist</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Chekhov&#x2019;s unique ability to be a scientist and an artist, a medical doctor and a writer, to always be present in his writings as an observer and narrator, unfailingly compassionate, but never overbearing, makes Chekhov a role model to which we can all aspire. After reading Narayan&#x2019;s book, you may want to run out and read Chekhov before you sit down to do any of your own writing. I do not think Narayan would find this upsetting at all. Perhaps it is even what she intends. I have always heard it said that you write as well as what you read. Bravo to Narayan for reminding us of this crucial truth. She has clearly learned deeply from her muse. Her writing sparkles with all the glittering qualities of Chekhov&#x2019;s work&#x2014;brevity, precision, audacity, and the desire to tell things as they are, and to do so with love, humor, and abiding curiosity for what makes human beings such endlessly interesting creatures.&#x201d; (Ruth Behar <i>Current Anthropology</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Alive in the Writing</i>&nbsp;is a gem of a book. Insightful and lively to read, it is of use to both beginning and seasoned ethnographers, as well as to anyone who wants to improve his or her writing about social life. . . . Inspired by her own work as an anthropologist and folklorist, Narayan draws on Chekhov&#x2019;s life and his ethnographic work,&nbsp;<i>Sakhalin Island</i>, as well as the works of other ethnographers, to offer an imaginative, engaging, and highly useful series of exercises and advice to make ethnographic writing come alive.&#x201d; (Elizabeth Fine <i>Journal of Folklore Research</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Balm for the loneliness and torment of the ethnographic writer, this manual by one of the most distinguished offers the user a personal&nbsp; writer's workshop, at once charming, therapeutic, and practical.

The bigger thing I'd like to know is, do you have any thoughts on how to put all the different little bits together?&#x2019; With the help of Anton Chekhov, her muse and obsession, Narayan does.&#x201d;--George Marcus, author of&nbsp;<i>Ethnography through Thick and Thin</i> (George Marcus 2011-11-22)<br><br>&#x201c;With a deft touch and an unlikely muse (Anton Chekhov), this consummate writer and reader of ethnographies has turned her deep appreciation of the craft and its promise into a gift for anthropologists. Narayan offers models of and models for ethnographic writing that will inspire us. I am eager to teach the book, but just as eager to learn from it.&#x201d;--Lila Abu-Lughod, author of <i>Writing Women&#x2019;s Worlds</i> (Lila Abu-Lughod 2011-11-22)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Narayan skillfully weaves the story of Anton Chekhov&#x2019;s visit to Sakhalin Island and its literary/ethnographic result, deftly chosen excerpts from contemporary ethnographic writing, and her own experience as anthropologist and teacher to create an insightful and above all helpful set of thoughts, tips, and exercises for anyone writing ethnography themselves. Read it and use it, you won&#x2019;t find anything better.&#x201d;</p> (Howard S. Becker, author of Writing for Social Scientists)<br><br><p>"The sustained interaction with Chekhov's life, work, and writing practices is unusual for a book devoted to craft, but it's a very productive and enjoyable through-line. The author weaves together rich examples from anthropological texts, and these examples collaborate beautifully with her inquiry into Chekhov's artistry and with the writing exercises she presents. Elegant in their simplicity and sensibleness, the exercises invite readers to experiment, and they help translate theoretical concepts into concerns that writers of all levels share."</p> (Michele Morano 2011-11-22)<br><br>&#x201c;Alive in the Writing is simply a delight to read. It walks its talk. It is rich in exercises to develop an ethnographic writer's talents and surprising in its stories of Chekhov as ethnographer. Narayan's marvelous manual for writers (and readers) of ethnography as well as creative nonfiction will be a cornerstone for much-needed courses in writing culture.&#x201d;--Renato Rosaldo, coauthor of <i>Culture &amp; Truth</i> (Renato Rosaldo 2011-11-22)</p><h2>The Complete Works of Isaac Babel</h2><p><p><strong>Language - English <br></strong></p> <p><strong>"A celebration of literary genius framed by 20th-century tragedy."--Richard Bernstein, <em>New York Times</em></strong></p> Finally in paperback, this "monumental collection; gathers all of Babel's deft and brutal writing, including a wide array of previously unavailable material, from never-before-translated stories to plays and film scripts" (David Ulin, <em>Los Angeles Times</em>). Reviewing the work in <em>The New Republic</em>, James Woods wrote that this groundbreaking volume "represents a triumph of translating, editing, and publishing.

Like Chekhov, Isaac Babel primarily wrote odd, tightly wrung little stories in which he displays a variety of convincing styles and tones, with each piece having an immediacy and weight that exceeds its brevity.<p> Babel's writing life lasted approximately 20 years. (He was executed by Stalin after a few military subjects unflatteringly portrayed in his "Red Cavalry" stories gained positions of influence.) His most notable stories depict the Russian civil war and Jewish soldiers, his childhood, and Jewish thugs in his native Odessa. Often journalistic in style, his stories provided gripping war accounts to Russians eager for news from the front, as in this passage from "The Church in Novograd": </p><blockquote>We drank rum, waiting for the military commissar, but he still hadn't come back from the headquarters. Romuald had collapsed in a corner and fallen asleep. He slept and quivered, while beyond the window an alley seeped into the garden beneath the black passion of the sky. Thirsting roses swayed in the darkness. Green lightning bolts blazed over the cupolas. A naked corpse lay on the embankment. And the rays of the moon streamed through the dead legs that are pointing upward. So this is Poland...</blockquote> This collection is a delight for its organization: the stories are grouped by periods, feature introductions, and include helpful maps.

It may seem today that the answers to all fundamental questions lie in the province of science, and that the scientific advances of the twentieth century leave little room for God. Cosmologists have rolled back their theories to the moment of the Big Bang; the discovery of DNA reveals the key to life; the theory of evolution explains the development of life--and with each new discovery or development, it seems that we are closer to a complete understanding of how things are. For many people, this gives strength to the belief that God is not needed to explain the universe; that religious belief is not based on reason; and that the existence of God is, intellectually, a lost cause.<br> Richard Swinburne, one of the most distinguished philosophers of religion today, argues that on the contrary, science provides good grounds for belief in God. Why is there a universe <em>at all</em>? Why is there <em>any</em> life on Earth? <em>How</em> is it that discoverable scientific laws operate in the universe? Swinburne uses these methods of scientific reasoning to argue that the best answers to these questions are given by the existence of God. The picture of the universe that science gives us is completed by God. Powerful, modern, and accessible, <em>Is There a God?</em> is must reading for anyone interested in an intelligent and approachable defence of the existence of God.</p><p><br><strong>Richard Swinburne</strong> is Nolloth Professor of Christian Religion at the Oxford University and the author of many books on the philosophy of religion and the philosophy of Christianity.<br>`Is There a God? is an honest, decently unspectacular presentation of one version of the case - Swinburne calls it theism - for the existence of God.'<br>Scotland on Sunday<br><br>`If you are looking for a book which will help you to see that there is more than what you daily observe with your senses, this is a good book to read.'<br>The Tablet<br><br>`Many lay people may be gratified to discover that the kind of intellectual reasoning which they are accustomed in their working life is here applied to the question of belief in God.'<br>The Expository Times<br><br>`Readable and logical ...

To study medicine is generally rated one of the major educational ordeals of American youth. The difficulty of this process and how medical students feel about their training, their doctor-teachers, and the profession they are entering is the target of this study. Now regarded as a classic, <em>Boys in White </em>is of vital interest to medical educators and sociologists.</p> <p>By daily interviews and observations in classes, wards, laboratories, and operating theaters, the team of sociologists who carried out this firsthand research have not only captured the worries, cynicism, and basic idealism of medical students&#x2014;they have also documented many other realities of medical education in relation to society. With some sixty tables and illustrations, the book is a major experiment in analyzing and presenting qualitative data.</p></p><p><p>Howard S.

As the relationship between Jean-Jacques Rousseau and David Hume unraveled, a volley of rancorous letters was fired off, then quickly published and devoured by aristocrats, intellectuals, and common readers alike. Everyone took sides in this momentous dispute between the greatest of Enlightenment thinkers.<br><br>In this lively and revealing book, Robert Zaretsky and John T. Scott explore the unfolding rift between Rousseau and Hume. The authors are particularly fascinated by the connection between the thinkers&#x2019; lives and thought, especially the way that the failure of each to understand the other&#x2014;and himself&#x2014;illuminates the limits of human understanding. In addition, they situate the philosophers&#x2019; quarrel in the social, political, and intellectual milieu that informed their actions, as well as the actions&nbsp;of the other participants in the dispute, such as James Boswell, Adam Smith, and Voltaire.

In the early 1990s, New York City launched an initiative under the banner of Broken Windows policing to dramatically expand enforcement against low-level offenses. <i>Misdemeanorland</i> is the first book to document the fates of the hundreds of thousands of people hauled into lower criminal courts as part of this policing experiment.</p><p>Drawing on three years of fieldwork inside and outside of the courtroom, in-depth interviews, and analysis of trends in arrests and dispositions of misdemeanors going back three decades, Issa Kohler-Hausmann argues that lower courts have largely abandoned the adjudicative model of criminal law administration in which questions of factual guilt and legal punishment drive case outcomes. Due to the sheer volume of arrests, lower courts have adopted a managerial model--and the implications are troubling. Kohler-Hausmann shows how significant volumes of people are marked, tested, and subjected to surveillance and control even though about half the cases result in some form of legal dismissal. She describes in harrowing detail how the reach of America's penal state extends well beyond the shocking numbers of people incarcerated in prisons or stigmatized by a felony conviction.</p><p>Revealing and innovative, <i>Misdemeanorland</i> shows how the lower reaches of our criminal justice system operate as a form of social control and surveillance, often without adjudicating cases or imposing formal punishment.</p></p><p><p>"Rarely does a book come along that changes minds and transforms understandings. This is one of them. It is theoretically rich, methodologically sophisticated, and substantively challenging. Readers, whether experienced criminal justice practitioners or sophisticated scholars, will come away with new insights about what they thought they knew. Quite simply, <i>Misdemeanorland</i> is one of the best books ever written on courts, criminal or otherwise."<b>--Malcolm M. Feeley, author of <i>The Process Is the Punishment: Handling Cases in a Lower Criminal Court</i></b></p><p>"For those of us who grew up believing that &#x2018;the process is the punishment,&#x2019; Kohler-Hausmann&#x2019;s study of New York City&#x2019;s singular misdemeanor justice system makes clear that the costs of low-level criminal justice processing can be devastating to people even when conviction rates are low. There is much to learn here for both academics and practitioners."<b>--Tracey Meares, Yale Law School</b></p><p>"Somewhere between stop-and-frisk and mass incarceration stands the misdemeanor court, where millions of Americans spend months waiting to answer for the low-level arrests that are now part of life in poor communities of color. Issa Kohler-Hausmann takes readers on a tour of Misdemeanorland, where justice is overwhelmed by massive caseloads and a grinding bureaucracy that takes little notice of the ordinary lives disrupted and sometimes upended by the powers of arrest and incarceration."<b>--Bruce Western, professor of sociology at Harvard University and codirector of the Justice Lab at Columbia University</b></p><p> "In this capacious book, criminal defense attorney, sociologist, and legal scholar Issa Kohler-Hausmann takes us inside New York City's lower criminal courts. She shows that, instead of deciding guilt and innocence and meting out appropriate sentences, misdemeanor courts largely manage people through record keeping and procedural hassle. As a result, people accused of minor crimes come to experience the justice system as arbitrary and dysfunctional.

He exposes how some medical healthcare and legal professionals prey on the anxieties and greed of their clients. He argues that whiplash is only one of a long list of largely fabricated illnesses and injuries that will drain resources from the health care system.</p><p>Andrew Malleson is the author of Need Your Doctor Be So Useless? and The Medical Runaround. He was a psychiatrist with the Toronto University Health Network and a consultant to the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute. He has frequently served as a medical exThe term "whiplash" conjures up images of a violent encounter between two automobiles, spider-webbed windshields, broken bones, and twisted metal. In fact, whiplash claims are just as likely to result from low-energy "bumper thumps" as they are from more destructive collisions. Ten percent of persons who make whiplash claims report a substantial permanent disability. So how can whiplash be considered a "useful" illness? In Whiplash and Other Useful Illnesses, Andrew Malleson details the evolution of whiplash, from its innocuous beginnings in 1928, when Harold Crowe first used the term at a meeting of orthopedic surgeons to describe eight cases of neck injury, to its present medicolegal standing, which results in costs of $13 billion to $18 billion annually in the United States. Spine specialists have long known that patients with secondary gains -- workers' compensation claims or lawsuits -- have significantly worse outcomes than those who do not. In fact, in scientific studies designed to judge the efficacy of interventions, investigators must exclude such patients or report their results separately. Of course, such considerations are not limited to spine-related injuries. In a broad sense, Whiplash and Other Useful Illnesses is about the way in which illnesses for which patients may receive compensation are created and sustained for the benefit of a few at the expense of many. Malleson chooses to write about whiplash, the condition he has spent the most time researching and with which he is most familiar. But his observations are applicable to a broad spectrum of manufactured medicolegal illnesses. Malleson writes with a self-admitted bias from years of working as a defense expert in legal cases involving whiplash and other illnesses for which patients may be compensated. He meticulously conveys his thesis in this thoroughly referenced and documented book. The book includes 59 pages of chapter-by-chapter notations and 56 pages of references. In a somewhat tedious manner, Malleson initially details the "junk science" that has given whiplash the status of a legitimate (and thereby compensable) illness. A psychiatrist by training, he particularly faults physicians for publishing poor scientific work in an effort to advertise themselves as experts in the field. This advertising allows them to secure an additional lucrative source of income in the face of a contracting health care market. He points out the insidious effort to legitimize the condition and discusses the interactions of medicine, lawyers, and the media that create "epidemics" by taking advantage of people's suggestible nature. Malleson draws parallels with other illnesses that were "fashionable" in other periods, such as "railway spine" and "repetitive strain injury," which reached nearly epidemic proportions in other countries until laws allowing compensation were rescinded. After the revocation of these laws, the ailments virtually disappeared. Whiplash claims, however, continue to multiply relentlessly, shifting vital resources and money away from where they are truly needed within the health care system to the benefit of a select few "victims," doctors, and lawyers. Malleson faults this conspiracy for its role in perpetuating the concept of whiplash as a form of prolonged disability. He scathingly criticizes many subspecialties within medicine for jumping on the "whiplash bandwagon" and perpetuating the pretense of lasting harm in the face of what should be an innocuous event. His portrayal of physicians as driven primarily by greed and self-interest under the guise of their patients' best interests, however, appears to be unwarranted and unsubstantiated. Lawyers are singled out for attempting to enrich themselves by means of the "whiplash lottery" and simultaneously allowing their clients to become professional patients who will not ultimately be cured by the verdict. Furthermore, lawyers continually fight to maintain the current adversarial system, which wastes valuable legal and health care resources. Malleson believes that many patients use whiplash as a convenient diagnosis to mask preexisting depression. It is socially more acceptable to be the victim of another person than to admit to being depressed, since depression comes from within. In this manner, an accident can be viewed as a reputable and rewarding escape from a difficult situation. Finally, Malleson faults insurance companies for not doing enough to combat fraudulent claims, instead using the losses incurred to justify further rate increases for all customers. Malleson's writing style is somewhat dry, and the individual chapters do not seem to flow into one another, making the reading slow and the book difficult to pick up at times. Nonetheless, his thesis is credible and well substantiated. He provides the perspective of someone who has spent many years of practice inside a medicolegal system that he feels is fundamentally flawed and in need of immediate reform. With the health care system in crisis, we can no longer afford expensive, ineffective therapies that are often used only to meet an arbitrary minimal monetary threshold for bringing suit or demonstrating long-term disability. Malleson's repeated call for randomized clinical trials to substantiate the efficacy of medical interventions is shared by most in the field of medicine. Whiplash and Other Useful Illnesses isfor anyone involved with persons seeking care or compensation for illness. <i>Brian Grottkau, M.D.</i><br>Copyright � 2003 Massachusetts Medical Society.

Bestselling author and acclaimed teacher Roger Housden says yes in this alternative to nonstop striving and self-criticism. Whether about our relationships, careers, or spirituality, many of us judge ourselves as not measuring up when we would certainly experience more fulfillment if we stopped struggling with ourselves. Housden came to some of these realizations in an extraordinarily challenging situation: being questioned by authorities while researching a book in Iran. In the midst of confinement, he knew, beyond all logic or reason, that he was actually free. Most of us will never find ourselves in such an extreme set of circumstances, but we may feel trapped by our behavior and experiences. Housden&#x2019;s words affirm that we can find peace and contentment, no matter what.</p><p><b>Roger Housden</b> is the author of twenty-two books, including the bestselling Ten Poems series. His writing has been featured in many publications, including the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, and <i>O: The Oprah Magazine</i>.

Using clear language and warm human terms, experienced therapist and teacher Patricia DeYoung addresses the challenges and rewards of doing relational therapy. She presents relational therapy against a wide range of contemporary psychotherapies, weaving a working synthesis of self psychology, intersubjective theory, various psychoanalytically informed developmental theories, relational psychoanalysis, and feminist self-in-relation theory. <em>Relational Psychotherapy</em> is an essential reference text for both therapists and students, while its personal and lucid writing style make it easily accessible to clients interested in learning more about psychotherapy.</p><p><strong>Patricia A.

His work, presented in over twenty books, lies on the borders of philosophy, anthropology and ethnology, and cultural theory. </p> <p>The present volume consists of diverse individual texts, produced between 1980 and 1986, which take two forms: interviews in which Bourdieu confronts a series of probing and intelligent interviewers, and conference papers that clarify and extend specific areas of his research. Now that Bourdieu's work has achieved wide diffusion and celebrity, this is an appropriate time for this volume, a pause for retrospection and resynthesis, for corrections of misreadings and extension of previous insights, and for projection of the next stages of his work. For this English edition, Bourdieu's celebrated inaugural lecture at the Coll�ge de France, <i>Le�on sur la Le�on</i>, has been added. </p> <p>The texts fall into two fundamental areas. The first area provides an overview of Bourdieu's central concepts, never before clearly explained. The second area clarifies the philosophical presuppositions of Bourdieu's studies and gives an account of his relations with the series of thinkers who formulated the problems in social and cultural theory that still preoccupy us: Kant, Hegel, Marx, Durkheim, Wittgenstein, Weber, Parsons, and L�vi-Strauss. Bourdieu's visions of these figures is personal and penetrating, and in his vivacious, spontaneous responses one sees at work a mode of thought that can in itself be a liberating tool of social analysis. Bourdieu applies to himself the method of analyzing cultural works that he expounds, evoking the space of theoretical possibilities presented to him at different moments of his intellectual itinerary. </p></p><p>&#x201c;A synthesis and amplification to those already familiar with Bourdieu&#x2019;s work and a useful introduction for new readers.&#x201d; &#x2014;Ethics<br>&#x201c;To read In Other Words is to enjoy a mind that works on many levels at once. Bourdieu seems perfectly able to reason coherently about any number of subjects (here he takes up sport, art, fieldwork, literature, philosophy, and opinion polls, among others). . . . It is an excellent informal guide to Bourdieu&#x2019;s sociological self-understanding. . . . This book may well be just the right introduction to an elegant and important thinker&#x2014;possibly the most inventive thinker in sociology today.&#x201d;&#x2014;American Journal of SociologyPierre Bourdieu is Professor of Sociology at the Coll�ge de France and Director of the Center for European Sociology at the �cole de Hautes �tudes en Sciences Sociales.</p><h2>Frankenstein</h2><p>Composed-as-part-of-a-challenge-between-Byron-and-Shelley-to-conjure-up-the-most-terrifying-ghost-story-Frankenstein-narrates-the-chilling-tale-of-a-being-created-by-a-bright-young-scientist-and-the-catastrophic-consequences-that-ensue</p><p>Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley (1797-1851) was an English author.

Thus begins the classic story of survival and adventure that has fired the imaginations of readers since it first appeared in 1812. With optimism and boundless enthusiasm, the Robinson family undertakes the extraordinary task of constructing a home for themselves and exploring the primitive island filled with strange and beautiful creatures and exotic fruits and plants. Rich in action and suspense, <i>The Swiss Family Robinson</i>&nbsp;is an exhilarating novel takes us to a faraway place of danger and beauty, where the courageous Robinson family embarks on a thrilling new life of adventure and discovery.<br><br><b>With an Introduction by J. Hillis miller<br>and an Afterword by Elizabeth Janeway&nbsp;</b></p><p>"For many days we had been tempest-tossed . . .the raging storm increased in fury on the seventh day all hope was lost." From these dire opening lines, a delightful story of adventure begins. One family will emerge alive from this terrible storm: the Robinson's -- a Swiss pastor, his wife, and four sons, plus two dogs and a shipload of livestock, hens, pigeons and geese! Inspired by Daniel Defoe's "Robinson Cruesoe," this heartwarming tale portrays a family's struggle to create a new life for themselves on a strange and fantastic tropical island. There each boy must learn to control his own nature -- such as Ernest's bookishness and Fritz's hot temper -- as their adventures lead to amazing discoveries, danger, and tantalizing surprises, including a puzzling message tied to an albatross's leg. But it is the authenticity of the boys' behavior, the ingenuity of the family, and the natural wonders of this exotic land that have made <i>The Swiss Family Robinson</i>, first published in 1812-1813, one of the world's best-loved and most enduring stories of shipwreck and survival.<b>Johann David Wyss</b> (1743&#x2013;1818) was an army chaplain with four sons; it was to entertain them that he wrote <i>The Swiss Family Robinson</i>. His son Johan Rudolf prepared the manuscript for publication in Zurich in 1812&#x2013;13. The first English edition was translated by William Godwin in 1814.<br><br><b>J.

But the man whose name became shorthand for all that is ugly in politics was more engaging and nuanced than his reputation suggests. Christopher S. Celenza&#x2019;s <i>Machiavelli: A Portrait </i>removes the varnish of centuries to reveal not only the hardnosed political philosopher but the skilled diplomat, learned commentator on ancient history, comic playwright, tireless letter writer, and thwarted lover.</p><p>Machiavelli&#x2019;s hometown was the epicenter of the Italian Renaissance in the fifteenth century, a place of unparalleled artistic and intellectual attainments. But Florence was also riven by extraordinary violence. War and public executions were commonplace&#x2015;Machiavelli himself was imprisoned and brutally tortured at the behest of his own government. These experiences left a deep impression on this keen observer of power politics, whose two masterpieces&#x2015;<i>The Prince </i>and <i>The Discourses</i>&#x2015;draw everywhere on the hard-won wisdom gained from navigating a treacherous world. But like many of Machiavelli&#x2019;s fellow Florentines, he also immersed himself in the Latin language and wisdom of authors from the classical past. And for all of Machiavelli&#x2019;s indifference to religion, vestiges of Christianity remained in his thought, especially the hope for a redeemer&#x2015;a prince who would provide the stability so rare in Machiavelli&#x2019;s worldly experience.</p></p><p>Christopher S. Celenza is Chairman of the Classics Department and Charles Homer Haskins Professor at Johns Hopkins University. &nbsp;From 2010-2014 he served as Director of the American Academy in Rome.&#x201c;By setting the author of <i>The Prince</i> in his historical context, <b>Christopher Celenza</b> captures the brilliance, risk-taking, danger, and sheer exuberant delight of the Italian Renaissance. With particular sensitivity to the precise nuances of Machiavelli&#x2019;s language, Celenza enables us to seize upon what continues to be relevant in his work to our own time and place.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Stephen Greenblatt, author of <i>The Swerve: How the World Became Modern</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<b>Celenza</b>&#x2019;s Machiavelli is a man passionately engaged in history, a scholar of the past whose interests run from the remote annals of ancient Rome to the tormented chronicles of early modern Italy, and an unflaggingly committed participant in the events of his own time.

Procedures are described for testing hypotheses about the mechanisms by which causal effects operate, the conditions under which they occur, and the moderation of mechanisms. Relying on the principles of ordinary least squares regression, Andrew Hayes carefully explains the estimation and interpretation of direct and indirect effects, probing and visualization of interactions, and testing of questions about moderated mediation. Examples using data from published studies illustrate how to conduct and report the analyses described in the book. Of special value, the book introduces and documents PROCESS, a macro for SPSS and SAS that does all the computations described in the book. The companion website (www.afhayes.com) offers free downloads of PROCESS plus data files for the book's examples.<br><br> Unique features include:<br> *Compelling examples (presumed media influence, sex discrimination in the workplace, and more) with real data; boxes with SAS, SPSS, and PROCESS code; and loads of tips, including how to report mediation, moderation and conditional process analyses.<br> *Appendix that presents documentation on use and features of PROCESS.&nbsp;<br> *Online supplement providing data, code, and syntax for the book's examples.</p><p><p>Andrew F. Hayes, PhD, is Professor of Quantitative Psychology at The Ohio State University. His research and writing on data analysis has been published widely. Dr. Hayes is the author of<i> Introduction to Mediation, Moderation, and Conditional Process Analysis</i> and <i>Statistical Methods for Communication Science,</i> as well as coauthor, with Richard B. Darlington, of <i>Regression Analysis and Linear Models.</i> He teaches data analysis, primarily at the graduate level, and frequently conducts workshops on statistical analysis throughout the world. His website is <i>www.afhayes.com.</i></p>"Mediation and moderation are two of the most widely used statistical tools in the social sciences. Students and experienced researchers have been waiting for a clear, engaging, and comprehensive book on these topics for years, but the wait has been worth it--this book is an absolute winner. With his usual clarity, Hayes has written what will become the default resource on mediation and moderation for many years to come."--Andy Field, PhD, School of Psychology, University of Sussex, United Kingdom<br><br> "Hayes provides an accessible, thorough introduction to the analysis of models containing mediators, moderators, or both. The text is easy to follow and written at a level appropriate for an introductory graduate course on mediation and moderation analysis. The book is also an extremely useful resource for applied researchers interested in analyzing conditional process models. One strength is the inclusion of numerous examples using real data, with step-by-step instructions for analysis of the data and interpretation of the results. This book's largest contribution to the field is its replacement of the confusing terminology of mediated moderation and moderated mediation with the clearer and broader term <i>conditional process model</i>."--Matthew Fritz, PhD, Department of Educational Psychology, University of Nebraska-Lincoln<br><br> "A welcome contribution. This book's accessible language and diverse set of examples will appeal to a wide variety of substantive researchers looking to explore how or why, and under what conditions, relationships among variables exist. Hayes has a unique ability to effectively communicate technical material to nontechnical audiences. He facilitates application of several cutting-edge statistical models by providing practical, well-oiled machinery for conducting the analyses in practice. I can use this book to enhance my graduate-level mediation class by extending the course to include more coverage on differentiating mediation versus moderation and on conditional process models that simultaneously evaluate both effects together."--Amanda Jane Fairchild, PhD, Department of Psychology, University of South Carolina<br><br> "This decidedly readable, informative book is perfectly suited for a range of audiences, from the novice graduate student not quite ready for SEM to the advanced statistics instructor. Even the seasoned quantitative methodologist will benefit from Hayes's years of accumulated wisdom as he expertly navigates this burgeoning--and at times inconsistent--literature. This book is particularly well suited for graduate-level courses. Hayes brings conditional process analysis to life with such passion that even the most 'stat-o-phobic' will become convinced that they too can master SPSS (or SAS) process. The thoughtful use of real-life examples, accompanied by SPSS and SAS syntax and output, makes the book highly accessible."--Shelley Brown, PhD, Department of Psychology, Carleton University, Canada<br><br>&#x201c;This book elegantly presents both the basic and advanced issues of mediation and moderation analysis...it will be beneficial for graduate students and applied researchers who are interested in causal mechanisms using linear models....[T]his is a very good textbook for applied researchers in social sciences. It covers mediation and moderation analysis using regression techniques quite nicely. The online materials of this book provide the data and software code for SAS and SPSS, which are very helpful supplements. I think this book could be very useful for both preliminary and advanced readers who are interested in mediation and moderation analysis.&#x201d;<i></i> (<i>Journal of American Statistical Association</i> 2014-11-13)<br><br>&#x201c;The book is very readable and conversational, providing many interesting and useful examples....I found this to be a very nice book that is readable enough for the intermediate statistics user but with enough technical detail to appeal to advanced users as well. The first three sections provide a thorough presentation of regression analysis and its use in answering questions of mediation and moderation. The inclusion of helpful SPSS macros and SAS programs for better estimation of these models is a very attractive quality....The final section on conditional process analysis is illuminating and thought-provoking, and for the reader unfamiliar with these topics will definitely peak interest.

Authors James H. Stock and Mark W. Watson integrate real-world questions and data into the development of the theory, with serious treatment of the substantive findings of the resulting empirical analysis.</p><p></p><h2>Epidemiology: An Introduction</h2><p>In the past thirty years epidemiology has matured from a fledgling scientific field into a vibrant discipline that brings together the biological and social sciences, and in doing so draws upon disciplines ranging from statistics and survey sampling to the philosophy of science. These areas of knowledge have converged into a modern theory of epidemiology that has been slow to penetrate into textbooks, particularly at the introductory level. <em>Epidemiology: An Introduction</em> closes the gap. It begins with a brief, lucid discussion of causal thinking and causal inference and then takes the reader through the elements of epidemiology, focusing on the measures of disease occurrence and causal effects. With these building blocks in place, the reader learns how to design, analyze and interpret problems that epidemiologists face, including confounding, the role of chance, and the exploration of interactions. All these topics are layered on the foundation of basic principles presented in simple language, with numerous examples and questions for further thought.</p><p>Kenneth J.

The book is laid out in four parts. The first part teaches the Hebrew alphabet through a series of lessons. The second part teaches word and sentence structure of the Hebrew language by breaking down each Hebrew word in Genesis chapter one, verses one through five. The Hebrew text of Genesis chapter one is provided for reading and comprehension practices in part three. The fourth part of the book contains charts and dictionaries of prefixes, suffixes, words and roots of the Hebrew language to assist the reader with vocabulary definitions and comprehension. Within a short amount of time the Hebrew student will soon be reading the Bible through the eyes of the author rather than the opinions of a translator.</p><p>Everything the beginning student of Hebrew needs to begin reading the Bible in its original language, from learning the Hebrew alphabet to word and sentence structure.When I began learning Hebrew about ten years ago I kept a notebook of words, roots, charts of prefixes and suffixes to make the studying easier.

They both earned their Ph.D. degrees at the University of Iowa from G. Robert Carlsen, a pioneer in the field of young adult literature. Ken was Carlsen&#x2019;s first Ph.D. student, with Alleen coming along a decade later. When Alleen and her husband moved to Arizona State in 1973, one of the first people she visited was Ken because Professor Carlsen had talked about him in class and had recruited Alleen as a writer for the Arizona English Bulletin, which Ken was editing.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Professor Carlsen was surprised when his two former students, who happened to find themselves in the same part of the country, started working together because he thought they were so different.&nbsp; Ken writes like a historian, focusing on what&#x2019;s old, while Alleen writes like a journalist, focusing on what&#x2019;s new. And while Ken was a leader in fighting censorship, Alleen was a leader in fighting sexist language, which some people interpret as a form of censorship. She is the one who suggested they take turns with whose name goes first on each edition.&nbsp; In spite of their differences, what they learned from Professor Carlsen brought them together in support of the academic study of young adult literature.&nbsp; In 1973, they helped found ALAN (Assembly on Literature for Adolescents of NCTE); both have received ALAN&#x2019;s Award for &#x201c;Outstanding Contributions to the Field of Young Adult Literature,&#x201d; and both served as presidents of ALAN. In 1974, they were the founding editors of <i>The ALAN Newsletter</i>, the forerunner of what is now <i>The ALAN Review.&nbsp; </i>After proving that they respected each other and could work together, they applied to be coeditors of the <i>English Journal</i>, a job they held from 1980 to 1987 when they wrote the first edition of <i>Literature for Today&#x2019;s Young Adults</i>.</p> <p>Thanks to Ken&#x2019;s knowledge of history and his interest in censorship, the book was more complete than other textbooks of the time which mostly focused on realistic problem novels&#x2013;books sometimes identified as <i>bildungsroman </i>or</p> <p> <i>apprenticeship </i>novels&#x2013;which are still the books most obviously identified as YA. But what Ken and Alleen demonstrated was that every genre, from adventure and biography to mysteries, fantasy, poetry, and the supernatural, were being written for teenagers and deserved a place in schools and libraries. And because Alleen&#x2019;s first job at Arizona State University was teaching in the Department of Library Science in the College of Education, it seemed natural for them to bring in the work of librarians and reading teachers as well as of English teachers.</p> <p>What has kept <i>Literature for Today&#x2019;s Young Adults </i>the leading textbook in the field is the authors&#x2019; continuing love and enthusiasm for their chosen field of study. For each edition they have highlighted new and interesting trends and illustrated them with lively discussions of well-written books. It has helped that they are well-rounded scholars and have remained active in education as a whole.</p> <p>Ken has published over five hundred articles, mostly on censorship, YA books, and problems in teaching secondary English reflecting his thirteen years of teaching high school English in Iowa. His articles, as well as others related to college teaching, have appeared in such journals as <i>Clearing House</i>, <i>English Journal</i>, <i>High School Journal</i>, and <i>School Library Journal</i>. Ken collected YA books published from 1850 through 1950 and when he retired from ASU he donated some eight hundred historical YA books and a nearly complete run of <i>The Dime Novel Round-Up </i>to ASU&#x2019;s Hayden Library. The collection is strong in books by Kirk Munroe, Ralph Henry Barbour, and John Tunis, and in two Stratemeyer Literary Syndicate heroes, Tom Swift and Nancy Drew.&nbsp; Alleen has worked with her husband, linguistics Professor Don L.

Nilsen, to promote a new approach to the teaching of vocabulary, as explained in<i> Vocabulary Plus: High School and Up: A Source-Based Approach and </i> <i>Vocabulary Plus K&#x2014;8: A Source-Based Approach </i> <i>(Pearson, 2004).

Leader, University of Glasgow)<i>Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics</i> is a textbook for advanced undergraduate students, graduate students, and anyone involved in biomedical research. Bioinformatics represents a new field at the interface of the twentieth century revolutions in molecular biology and computers. A focus of this new discipline is the use of computer databases and computer algorithms to study proteins, genes, and the complete collections of genes that comprise an organism (genomes). A major challenge in biology is to make sense of the enormous quantities of sequence data and structural data that are being generated by genome sequencing projects and other molecular biology efforts. The tools of bioinformatics include computer programs that help to reveal fundamental mechanisms underlying biological problems related to the structure and function of macromolecules, biochemical pathways, disease processes, and evolution. The aim of the book is to explain both the theory and practice of bioinformatics and genomics. The book is especially designed to help the biologist use computer programs and databases to solve biological problems.</p><h2>The Fairchild Dictionary of Fashion 3rd Edition</h2><p>Finding definitions for fashion is easier than ever. <i>The Fairchild Dictionary of Fashion</i>, 3rd Edition, defines more than 15,000 fashion terms, including apparel, accessories, and their components; historical and textile terms that relate to contemporary fashion; and the language of the fashion business.

Robbery, arson, torture, murder, swift and bloody raids on farms and settlements--these were the ingredients of the conflict. Approaching total war, the fighting engulfed the populace and challenged any notion of civility.<br> A slave state that rejected secession, Missouri was beset before the war by divisive tensions that exploded into extraordinary violence once the war began. "The guerrilla conflict," Michael Fellman writes, "truly was a spontaneous creation of the people, by the people, for the people, and against the people." It was a "natural," popular war, rather than a planned, disciplined one. Its "rules" grew directly out of local circumstances and bore scant relation to the history and traditions of martial order or to the dreams of a Christian Confederacy or a democratic United States. Little remained under control; little remained forbidden.<br> Fellman captures the conflict from the "inside," drawing on a wealth of first-hand evidence--letters, diaries, military reports, court-martial transcripts, depositions, and newspaper accounts. We gain a clear picture of the ideological, social, and economic forces that divided the populace and launched the conflict. We witness ordinary civilian men and women struggling to survive amid the random terror perpetuated by both sides. We learn how both Confederate and Union officials, contemptuous of guerrilla fighters and their tactics, nevertheless sought to use them to their own advantage. And we see at close hand what the combatants themselves were like--how they saw themselves, how others saw them, what drove them so often to commit atrocities and brutal acts of vengeance--and we learn about the beginnings of the legend of Jesse James and its origins in guerrilla war. <br> Vivid, probing, and often horrifying, <em>Inside War</em> illuminates a crucial episode of the American Civil War, shedding light not only on the institutional, strategic, and tactical elements but also the physical, emotional, and moral experiences of a people fully at war with themselves.</p><p>During the Civil War, the state of Missouri witnessed the most wide spread, prolonged, and destructive guerrilla fighting in American history. With its horrific combination of robbery, arson, torture, murder, and swift and bloody raids on farms and settlements, the conflict approached total war, engulfing the whole populace and challenging any notion of civility.<br><em>About the Author:</em><br><strong>Michael Fellman</strong> is Professor of History at Simon Fraser University in Canada.

The text comes directly from Parton's autobiographical hit country and western song of the same name. Perhaps the grammar is imperfect, but what C&amp;W song ain't rife with grammatical errors--it's part of the vernacular. The story centers on a poor, but happy and loving, family (yes, they do exist) who find clever ways to deal with their poverty. As winter approaches, Mama sews a coat for her daughter from a box of scraps that someone has given her. Of course her classmates make fun of her for having a coat made of rags. But sticks and stones... "And although we had no money / I was rich as I could be / in my coat of many colors / that Mama made for me." That doesn't mean the child's feelings aren't hurt, or that she didn't feel angry. But the message comes through loud and clear (like Parton's voice): the child's mother has provided her with the strength to deal with other children's jeers, and family love can sometimes be enough to pull a person through.In the 30 years since setting out alone for Nashville at the age of 18 with the hope of making a career for herself as a country singer, Dolly Parton has released 62 albums, many of which have gone gold and/or platinum, selling more than 50 million copies worldwide. <p>Admired as much for her song writing ability as for her singing, Parton composed such classics as "I Will Always Love You," "Coat of Many Colors," and "9 to 5," and has earned some 30 awards including 4 Grammys. She has also starred in several films, including "Steel Magnolias," "9 to 5," "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas," and "Straight Talk." Her theme park, Dollywood, built in 1986 in her native eastern Tennessee attracts hundreds of thousands of fans each year. About to release her own cosmetics line, Parton is one of the smartest businesswomen in the entertainment industry. </p><p>Parton also is as much a humanitarian as an entertainer. She is the founder of the Dollywood Foundation, a nonprofit organization established to support education and reduce the large high school dropout rate in her native Sevier County, Tennessee.

Following the author to Paris he traces Hemingway&#39;s movements across the city and outside, to Milan, Constantinople, Pamplona, Chartres and beyond, including his travels to and from the United States.</p><p>In the second of his series of five biographies of Ernest Hemingway, Michael Reynolds turns to the years that formed the writer's distinctive style and critical intelligence. He exhaustively chronicles the particular literary influences on Hemingway, oftentimes even recounting the reading lists that the writer received from particular individuals. "Reading <i>The Wasteland</i> with Ezra Pound at one's elbow is no bad way to pick up a thing or two," he dryly observes at one point. He also pays close attention to Hemingway's conversations with, and studying the literature of, Pound, James Joyce, and particularly Gertrude Stein, who later complained that for all of Hemingway's talent, "He looks like a modern and he smells of the museums." Reynolds's sympathy for his subject is so complete that at times his own stylistic voice becomes a sort of homage to Hemingway's--colloquial, declarative, and wry. At times, however, he too liberally assumes the inner thoughts of his subjects. The substantial research and period analysis he commands turn such repeated phrases as "he must have thought" or "it must have seemed to him" into an unnecessary striving for authority. At his best, though, Reynolds not only uses his extensive source material with a critical eye but provides a wealth of information about the social, political, and literary backgrounds of a time and place that were in many ways the dawn of the 20th century's intellectual tradition. <i>--John Longenbaugh</i>Michael Reynolds was a professor of English at North Carolina State University and a finalist for the National Book Award for Young Hemingway.

Drawing upon labor, biographical, economic, and military histories, the book offers a unique blend of perspectives of history from both above and below, from under-studied as well as often-studied regions, and from a combination of archival and classic sources that will allow readers to engage in a meaningful way with the Latin American past.&nbsp; </p></p><p><p> <b>Erin E.

In <i>The</i> <i>Elusive Obvious</i> he presents ideas that are more relevant today than when the book was first published, as current research strongly supports many of the insights on which the Feldenkrais Method is based. This beautiful new edition is ready to be treasured by an emerging generation of somatic practitioners, movement teachers, performing artists, and anyone interested in self-improvement and healing. The two main strands of the Feldenkrais Method&#x2014;Awareness Through Movement and Functional Integration&#x2014;are now known by many around the world for reducing pain and anxiety, cultivating vitality, and improving performance. <i>The Elusive Obvious </i>presents a thorough and accessible explanation of the Feldenkrais Method, and, as its title indicates, throws light on the solutions to many of our difficulties that are hidden in plain sight.</p><p>Dr. Moshe Feldenkrais, D.Sc., (1904-1984) was a distinguished scientist, physicist, and engineer, and the founder of the method that now bears his name. His insights contributed to the development of the new field of somatic education and continue to influence disciplines ranging from the arts to physical and occupational therapy.<i>&#x201c;The Elusive Obvious</i> gives readers a sense of what it may have been like to be with Feldenkrais in person. Across the pages, Feldenkrais&#x2019;s take on a range of topics is punctuated with flashes of brilliance (such as the exchange between him and anthropologist Margaret Mead), and occasional free associations, but he always circles back to his primary interest in habits, how we learn, and how to learn better or more gratifying ways of performing actions. It is here, in <i>The Elusive Obvious</i>, more than any other work of his that I know, that Feldenkrais makes clear the extent to which his understanding of brain plasticity informed his discoveries of how to help people, and it shows the firm scientific ground his method rested on.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Norman Doidge, MD, from the foreword<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A neck injury prevented me from playing my cello for almost a year.

Russell's paintings and sculptures might be surprised to learn how often he transformed his Western themes into book, newspaper, and magazine illustrations. He further propagated his vision of the West, and supported himself, by producing images for calendars and postcards, advertisements, businesses and organizations, and souvenir pamphlets for events. Russell's spirit pervades this volume, much as his art permeated late 19th- and early 20th-century society. Peterson has compiled a colorful visual display of Russell's Old West, including proud Native Americans, bold adventurers, angry bears, starving cattle, buffalo skulls, round-ups, and hold-ups. The intertwining of Russell's personal and professional lives is discussed in detail. An important addition to other recent books on Western arts, this is especially recommended for collectors and librarians wishing to better identify printed Russell material.AAnne Marie Lane, American Heritage Ctr., Laramie, WY<br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Blue At the Mizzen Uk</h2><p>The brand new Aubrey-Maturin novel, the twentieth in this classic series. &#39;If we had only two or three of Patrick O&#39;Brian&#39;s Aubrey-Maturin series, we would count ourselves lucky; with six or seven the author would be safely among the greats of historical fiction...This is great writing by an undiminished talent. Now on to Volume Twenty, and the liberation of Chile.&#39; WILLIAM WALDEGRAVE, Literary Review This is the twentieth book in Patrick O&#39;Brian&#39;s highly acclaimed, bestselling series chronicling the adventures of lucky Jack Aubrey and his best friend Stephen Maturin, part ship&#39;s doctor, part secret agent. The novel&#39;s stirring action follows on from that of The Hundred Days. Napoleon&#39;s hundred days of freedom and his renewed threat to Europe have ended at Waterloo and Aubrey has finally, as the title suggests, become a blue level admiral. He and Maturin have -- at last -- set sail on their much postponed mission to Chile. Vivid with the salty tang of life at sea, O&#39;Brian&#39;s writing is as powerful as ever whether he writes of naval hierarchies, night-actions or the most celebrated fictional friendship since that of Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson. Blue at the Mizzen also brings alive the sights and sounds of revolutionary South America in a story as exciting as any O&#39;Brian has written.</p><p>Almost three decades after commencing his maritime epic with <i>Master and Commander</i>, Patrick O'Brian is still at it. The 20th episode, <i>Blue at the Mizzen</i>, is another swashbuckling adventure on the high seas, complete with romantic escapades from smoggy London to Sierra Leone, diplomacy, espionage, the intricacies of warfare, and imperial brinksmanship. As always, these events are bound up in the ongoing friendship between two officers of the Royal Navy. Jack Aubrey is the naval captain, bold yet compassionate, innovative yet cautious, as fearless in war as he is bumbling in affairs of the heart and household. His boon companion Stephen Maturin is the ship's surgeon--and additionally a spy for the British government, a wealthy Catalonian aristocrat, a doting Irish father, and an avid naturalist.<p> That may sound like a lot to keep track of. However, it's not necessary to carry around a scorecard or ship's roster while reading <i>Blue at the Mizzen</i>. The ostensible issue is whether Jack will finally be promoted to Admiral of the Blue. But long before he hears any word from the Napoleonic era's equivalent of Personnel, he loses half his crew to desertion, his ship undergoes a disastrous collision, and the entire company comes close to perishing in the ice-choked seas off Cape Horn. Meanwhile, the widowed Maturin issues a surprising proposal of marriage to a beautiful, mud-bespattered fellow naturalist while trekking through an African mangrove swamp. (The two lovebirds happen to be searching for a rare variant of <i>Caprimulgus longipennis</i>, the long-tailed nightjar, which they hope to surprise in full mating plumage.)</p><p> Still, this is hardly a plot-driven novel. O'Brian takes time to get anywhere, and invariably enjoys the journey more than the arrival. So even as we get constant hints of the climax to come--Jack's spectacular naval action on behalf of the infant Republic of Chile--we don't mind hearing about the nuances of shipboard existence or the secret life of the white-faced tree duck. We're treated, for example, to this snippet about managed care, circa 1816: </p><blockquote> Poll, Maggie and a horse-leech from the starboard watch have been administering enemas to the many, many cases of gross surfeit that have now replaced the frostbites, torsions, and debility of the recent past, the very recent past. Strong, fresh, seal-meat has not its equal for upsetting the seaman's metabolism: he is much better kept on biscuits, Essex cheese, and a very little well-seethed salt pork--kept on short commons. </blockquote> And we're grateful! We can only hope that the elderly author will favor us with at least one more novel, so that his avid followers can avoid their own form of short commons. Life without Aubrey and Maturin would be a deprivation indeed. <i>--Andrew Himes</i>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Joy of Sets: Fundamentals of Contemporary Set Theory (Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics)</h2><p><p>This text covers the parts of contemporary set theory relevant to other areas of pure mathematics.

Then as now, many people considered globalization to be inevitable and irreversible. Yet the entire edifice collapsed in a few months in 1914.<br><br> Globalization is a choice, not a fact. It is a result of policy decisions and the politics that shape them. Jeffry A. Frieden's insightful history explores the golden age of globalization during the early years of the century, its swift collapse in the crises of 1914-45, the divisions of the Cold War world, and the turn again toward global integration at the end of the century. His history is full of character and event, as entertaining as it is enlightening.</p><p>Jeffry A. Frieden is Professor of Government at Harvard University. He specializes in the politics of international monetary and financial relations. Frieden is the author of Currency Politics: The Political Economy of Exchange Rate Politics and (with Menzie Chinn) of Lost Decades: The Making of America&#x2019;s Debt Crisis and the Long Recovery. His previous books include Global Capitalism: Its Fall and Rise in the Twentieth Century; Debt, Development, and Democracy: Modern Political Economy and Latin America, 1965&#x2013;1985; and Banking on the World: The Politics of American International Finance. He is also the co-author or co-editor of many other books on related topics. His articles on the politics of international economic issues have appeared in a wide variety of scholarly and general interest publications.Frieden, an academic, traces the history of globalization from the late 1800s to the present, telling us, "Global economy and culture form a nearly seamless web in which the national boundaries are increasingly irrelevant to trade, investment, finance and other economic activity." Globalization is a choice formed by politics and policy decisions. It is now considered the norm, a fact of life that will continue. However, the author points out that this was also true from the end of the 1800s to 1914 and the start of World War I. The foundations of preexisting global economic order disintegrated, reemerging in the 1970s but not thriving until the 1990s. International integration usually expands economic opportunities and benefits society, but global capitalism, which does not address those ill-treated by world markets (e.g., the unemployed, the poor, children and the elderly), has driven societies toward conflict and class warfare. This is an excellent, readable history of globalization with important lessons for our society today. <i>Mary Whaley</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Over the next three decades, this mosaic of cultures was modernized and homogenized out of existence by the ruling might of the Soviet Union, then Nazi Germany, and finally, Polish and Ukrainian nationalism. By the 1950s, this "no place" emerged as a Ukrainian heartland, and the fertile mix of peoples that defined the region was destroyed. </p><p>Brown's study is grounded in the life of the village and <i>shtetl</i>, in the personalities and small histories of everyday life in this area.

With compassion and respect for the diverse people who inhabited this margin of territory between Russia and Poland, Kate Brown restores the voices, memories, and humanity of a people lost.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Lynne Viola, Professor of History, University of Toronto</b><br><br>&#x201c;Samuel Butler and Kate Brown have something in common.

H. Auden</b><p><br>&nbsp;</p></p><p>With the opening sentence of The Metamorphosis Franz Kafka introduced modern man to his interior condition. After awaking to discover he has been transformed into an enormous insect, Gregor Samsa becomes an object of disgrace to his family and is left to hide away within the confines of his room. An imaginative parable about human alienation, The Metamorphosis is also an absurdly comic tale whose narrative effects remain revolutionary today.<p>Kafka's profound and humorous exploration of alienation and authority is found in the other fictional pieces he published during his lifetime, all collected in this edition. Included are Meditation, a group of Kafka's early studies; "The Judgement", his most powerful statement on the father-son conflict; "The Stoker", the first chapter of the unfinished novel Amerika; "In the Penal Colony", perhaps Kafka's most disturbing piece; A Country Doctor, tales written just before he contracted tuberculosis; the story "The Coal-Scuttle Rider"; and A Fasting-Artist, Kafka's final collection of stories, published just before his death.

With the dislocation of disciplinary boundaries in visual culture, art that is engaged with nature has also forged connections with a new range of scientific, historical, and philosophical ideas. Developing technologies make our interventions into natural systems both increasingly refined and profound. Advances in biological and telecommunication technology continually modify the way we present ourselves. So too are artistic representations of nature (human and otherwise) being transformed.</p><p>This anthology addresses these issues by considering how the rise of transdisciplinary practices in the postwar era allowed for new kinds of artistic engagement with nature. These include the postminimalist inscriptions associated with Land art; environmentally engaged practices designed to propose novel forms of stewardship; and more recent projects concerned with relationships between the most subtle and minute components of life and the large-scale appearance of the world. These projects unsettle the most basic operations of &#x201c;natural&#x201d; personhood and identity.</p><p>Including a wide range of writings by and about artists, juxtaposed with influential texts from diverse theoretical bases, this collection provides an overview of the eclectic scientific and philosophical sources that inform contemporary art's investigations of nature.</p></p><p>Jeffrey Kastner is a New York&#x2013;based writer and critic and senior editor of <i>Cabinet</i>.

And why do people invest their money--or their trust--in mysterious cryptocurrencies seemingly based on nothing?</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>In an era when trust in institutions of all kinds is collapsing, the blockchain offers a new hope: Shared ledgers of information that no one controls but everyone can believe. Since its emergence a decade ago with the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, the blockchain has spawned hundreds of companies, billions of dollars of investment, and adoption by companies ranging from the New York Stock Exchange to Walmart. Yet it remains wildly misunderstood.<br>&nbsp;<br>Wharton professor Kevin Werbach offers the first in-depth, balanced analysis of the blockchain's true potential, as well as its limitations and dangers. He maps the often-confusing landscape, and shows how a&nbsp;technology resting on foundations of mutual mistrust can become trustworthy. Surprisingly for a technology widely associated with illegality, fraud, and distrust of governments, the path to trusted blockchains runs through governance, regulation, and law. <br>&nbsp;</p><p>In their relatively short history, blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies have witnessed more than their share of booms and busts. I see a deeper story. Yes, the blockchain has been massively over-hyped. It's immature, prone to failures, hard to understand, and in the wrong hands, dangerous. Yet the blockchain is also something incredibly important: a new form of trust for a time when that's sorely needed.&nbsp;<br><br>Twenty years ago, I was part of the team in the U.S. government that developed the policy framework for the internet. I've studied many other emerging technologies since then, as an analyst, consultant, and business school professor. The blockchain is the first one I've seen that could be--and I emphasize could--as significant as the internet. Yet so many people I speak with say they simply don't understand it. And many who do na�vely think that for the blockchain to succeed, law and regulation must fail. We heard that in the early days of the internet as well. It was just as wrong then.<br><br>I set out to write a balanced book for anyone who has ever wondered what the blockchain is, and what it means for business and society. For anyone who wants to go deeper than a breezy description of Bitcoin without getting lost in technical details. For anyone curious about how a technology that eliminates central control points can actually prove trustworthy, and consistent with law. For anyone intrigued by the high-stakes challenges of regulation and governance in decentralized systems. For anyone wondering if the blockchain represents a new path forward for the internet. And for anyone seeking a glimmer of hope that we can overcome the global collapse of trust in traditional institutions.<br><br>Trust me, you'll learn something worthwhile!Kevin Werbach is Professor of Legal Studies and Business Ethics at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

William R. Keylor, Boston University, H-Net France<br><br>"...an engaging, even compelling, exploration of the comparative impact of 'mass death' on European culture....[a] nuanced study of the meaning of death and consolation. An erudite piece of scholarship that will certainly set the standard for future studies of its kind, this book is essential reading for anyone interested in the cultural history of the Great War."

He transforms our understanding of World War One as a cataclysmic event in the experience of European peoples.

Kenneth S. Inglis, Emeritus Professor at the Australian National University<br><br>"From now on this book will be indispensable to our understanding of the Great War.

Keith Robbins, Vice-Chancellor of Saint David's University College, Lampeter<br><br>"...the study is beautifully and sensitively written and adds new interpretations to our knowledge of the deeply felt need to memorialize the horrendous human losses of World War I....The volume will appeal to historians, psychologists, literature and art students who study the two World Wars." Agnes Peterson, History<br><br>"Otto Dix, he [Winter] tells us, carried both Nietzsche and the bible to the Front after he volunteered for the Imperial German armies, and that bitter image of the war (and society) which he would construct both during and after the conflict would be inspired by an intermingling of modern and ancient ideas. Dix's memory and that of most others would look both forward and back. The greatest strength in Winter's account lies in these moments of detailed reconstruction."

What does it mean for the statue that stands immobile in gallery or square to step down from its pedestal or speak out of its silence? What is it in this fantasy that animates us?</p><p><p>Kenneth Gross is also the author of<em> Spenserian Poetics: Idolatry, Iconoclasm, and Magic </em>(1985), <em>Shakespeare's Noise </em>(2001), and <em>Shylock is Shakespeare </em>(forthcoming in 2006). He teaches English at the University of Rochester.</p><p>&#x201c;Exploring a perennial fascination with the idea an animated statue and its converse (petrifaction of living individuals), Gross both delights and instructs the reader through an exploration of a quite astonishing number of significant examples that include poetry, film, drama, psychoanalysis, and philosophy, to say nothing of a few famous statues themselves. The style is inimitable: graceful, sophisticated, and seductive in the display of a sensibility that is at once both unique and accessible. The few pages of the preface alone give a hint of the riches that lie within, continually provoking the reader with the exhilarating experience of new insights into the workings of the imagination, the arousal of fear and desire, and the dangerously porous borderlines between the inanimate and the animate, the object and the subject, and finally, between death and life.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Froma I.

His exploration of mythology and legends&#x2014;from the petrifying stare of the Gorgon Medusa to the figure that comes to life when Pygmalion kisses his handiwork&#x2014;reveals their psychological complexity and philosophical richness. Effigies, puppets, and replicas open up questions about reality and unreality, and lead us to consider the ontology of representations.

With great economy, Gross is able to discuss the relevance of this motif from myriad theoretical perspectives as well, considering, for example, not only a psychoanalytic interpretation of individual works, but also the role of a desire for animation in Freud&#x2019;s own methods and the recurring interest in stasis and movement in the work of Wittgenstein.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Susan Stewart, Princeton University, Professor and author of <em>Poetry and the Fate of the Senses and Columbarium.</em></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;After <em>Hamlet in Purgatory</em>&#x2014;to name only one especially fine study intervening since <em>The Dream</em> was first written&#x2014;Shakespeare&#x2019;s secularism is perhaps the one topic on which this very wide-ranging but fifteen-year-old book might be showing its date.

Their movement has sparked innovation, spread ideas, relieved poverty, and laid the foundations for a global economy. In a world more interconnected than ever before, the number of people with the means and motivation to migrate will only increase.<i> Exceptional People</i> provides a long-term and global perspective on the implications and policy options for societies the world over. Challenging the received wisdom that a dramatic growth in migration is undesirable, the book proposes new approaches for governance that will embrace this international mobility.</p><br><p> The authors explore the critical role of human migration since humans first departed Africa some fifty thousand years ago--how the circulation of ideas and technologies has benefited communities and how the movement of people across oceans and continents has fueled economies. They show that migrants in today's world connect markets, fill labor gaps, and enrich social diversity. Migration also allows individuals to escape destitution, human rights abuses, and repressive regimes. However, the authors indicate that most current migration policies are based on misconceptions and fears about migration's long-term contributions and social dynamics. Future policies, for good or ill, will dramatically determine whether societies can effectively reap migration's opportunities while managing the risks of the twenty-first century.</p><br><p> A guide to vigorous debate and action, <i>Exceptional People</i> charts the past and present of international migration and makes practical recommendations that will allow everyone to benefit from its unstoppable future growth.</p></p><p><p>"A sweeping and constructive study. With a deep sense of what sort of creatures we humans are, this book takes us through millennia in the unending quest of people for development and discovery. It suggests that population movements have been the carriers of innovation from one region to others. It will change, if anything can, the way governments and international organizations view immigration policy."<b>--Edmund S. Phelps, Nobel Prize-winning economist</b></p><p>"Migration is not a zero-sum game; it brings great benefits to the receiving country, the sending country, and to migrants themselves. That is the clear message of the evidence from history, economics, and the social sciences more generally. This wise book assembles that evidence in a very thoughtful, careful, and scholarly way, making an enormous contribution to this crucial subject and providing fundamental guidance on one of the key issues of our times."<b>--Nicholas Stern, London School of Economics and Political Science</b></p><p>"In capturing the full sweep of immigration as a key part of human experience and development from the remote past to the distant future, <i>Exceptional People</i> strikes a perfect balance between sympathetic understanding of the basic motivations to migrate and hardheaded pragmatism with respect to government policy. The authors' narrative is insightful, clear-eyed, and deftly written, and will engage the attention of both experts and the interested lay audience."<b>--Michael Oppenheimer, Princeton University</b></p><p>"The fear of the outsider is a pervasive feature of Western culture. Yet, as the authors show so powerfully, we all owe our origins to historical migrations. Migrants are indeed exceptional people who enrich our societies and boost our economies by challenging conventional ways of doing things. This book reveals that migration is an essential part of human development and that we lose a great deal through widespread perceptions of migration as a problem. The global migration agenda proposed in this highly readable book shows how potential downsides could be reduced and enormous benefits realized."<b>--Stephen Castles, coauthor of <i>The Age of Migration</i></b></p><p>"In public discourse, migration may be the subject that minimizes the ratio of clarity to volume. The authors deserve high praise for joining this discussion with the quiet and clear yet firm voice that is the hallmark of economic analysis at its best."<b>--Paul Romer, Stanford University</b></p><p>"This clear and lively book is the most skillful articulation of the case for the liberalization of international migration. The authors consistently present migration's benefits, but do not ignore migration's costs or shy away from controversy.

In this book, written for both undergraduate and graduate students of chemistry and physics, the author looks at the continuing debate about the meaning of quantum theory. The historical development of the theory is traced from the turn of the century through to the 1930s, and the famous debate between Niels Bohr and Albert Einstein. The book examines in detail the arguments that quantum theory is incomplete, as made by Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen; the development of Bell's theorem; and crucial experimental tests performed in the early 1980s. Alternative interpretations -- pilot waves, quantum gravity, consciousness, and many worlds -- are described in the closing chapter.<br></p><p>Jim Baggott, Environmental Officer, Lubricants Marketing, Shell International.`I can recommend it warmly.

Ranging across five centuries of fiction, drama, and verse&#x2014;including tales as diverse as Horace Walpole's <i>The Castle of Otranto</i>, Shelley's <i>Frankenstein</i>, Coleridge's <i>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</i>, and Freud's <i>The Mysteries of Enlightenment</i>&#x2014;Anne Williams proposes three new premises: that Gothic is "poetic," not novelistic, in nature; that there are two parallel Gothic traditions, Male and Female; and that the Gothic and the Romantic represent a single literary tradition.<br> <br> Building on the psychoanalytic and feminist theory of Julia Kristeva, Williams argues that Gothic conventions such as the haunted castle and the family curse signify the fall of the patriarchal family; Gothic is therefore "poetic" in Kristeva's sense because it reveals those "others" most often identified with the female. Williams identifies distinct Male and Female Gothic traditions: In the Male plot, the protagonist faces a cruel, violent, and supernatural world, without hope of salvation. The Female plot, by contrast, asserts the power of the mind to comprehend a world which, though mysterious, is ultimately sensible. By showing how Coleridge and Keats used both Male and Female Gothic, Williams challenges accepted notions about gender and authorship among the Romantics. Lucidly and gracefully written, <i>Art of Darkness</i> alters our understanding of the Gothic tradition, of Romanticism, and of the relations between gender and genre in literary history.</p></p><p></p><h2>Holt, Rinehart and Winston English Workshop Second Course Grade 8 (HRW English Workshop)</h2><p>An overview of the writing process, parts of speech, grammar, punctuation and spelling.</p><p></p><h2>Auction Theory</h2><p><p><i>Auction Theory</i> is the standard reference on auctions and the first source of authoritative information about multi-unit auctions.

In a presentation that assumes no previous knowledge of assessment or measurement, the text provides crystal clear step-by-step instruction on such topics as constructing test questions, aligning assessment with learning goals, and interpreting standardized tests. Providing readers with an understanding of the role of assessment in the instructional process, the book helps students learn how to construct effective test questions that are aligned with learning objectives, evaluate published tests and properly interpret scores of standardized tests. The revision has been thoroughly updated and revised to include: The changing context of testing and assessment now required to meet state and federal assessment mandates; Many new examples of classroom assessments have been added; A stronger emphasis on the development of assessments testing higher order thinking skills, such as analysis, synthesis and evaluation; Updated discussion of student motivation on standardized test; Materials on published tests reflect new editions and new approaches to assessment; Significant coverage of the Standards Movement and <i>No Child Left Behind</i> legislation; Detailed, straightforward guidelines for how to construct test items with many concrete examples; and Coverage of both formative and summative assessment and of all practical aspects of classroom assessment teachers need. <i>Measurement and Assessment in Teaching</i>, tenth edition, introduces the elements of measurement and assessment that are essential to good teaching, once again paving the way for future educators.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> </p> <p> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>Highlights of the New Edition include:</b> </p> <li>Major revisions in Chapter 1 reflect the changing context of testing and assessment now required to meet state and federal assessment mandates </li> <li>Many new examples of classroom assessments have been added. </li> <li>Revisions in Chapter 6, Planning Classroom Tests and Assessments, give the chapter a stronger emphasis on the development of assessments testing higher order thinking skills, such as analysis, synthesis and evaluation. </li> <li>The discussion of student motivation on standardized tests in Chapter 18, Test Selection, Administration, and Use, is updated. </li> <li>References to many Web sites have been added or updated. </li> <li>Materials on published tests reflect new editions and new approaches to assessment.</li></p><p>The market-leader! This popular text introduces future classroom teachers to those elements of measurement and assessment that are essential to good teaching. Its straightforward treatment is predicated on the authors&#39; belief that evaluation of learning plays a pivotal role in the instructional process...and that its effectiveness depends on a teacher&#39;s ability to construct and select evaluation instruments that provide a valid measure of intended learning outcomes. Written with the introductory student in mind, it assumes no prior knowledge of statistics, and uses illustrative examples generously to explain and expand upon topics. Statistical concepts are introduced only as necessary for understanding, with the authors consistently emphasizing interpretation over computation.<p> <b>BCC for </b> </p> <p> <b>&nbsp;</b> </p> <p> <b> <i>Measurement and Assessment in Teaching</i>, 10/e</b> </p> <p> <b>M.

This innovative text helps students develop and sharpen their economic intuition--an invaluable skill that helps students, as future managers, decide which products to produce, costs to consider, and prices to charge, as well as the best hiring policy and the most effective style of organization. With its unique integrative approach, the text presents the firm as a cohesive, unified organization and demonstrates that important business decisions are interdisciplinary. A basic valuation model is constructed and used as the underlying economic model of the firm; each topic is then related to an element of the value maximization model--a process that shows how management integrates accounting, finance, marketing, personnel, and production functions. The text also provides an intuitive guide to marginal analysis and basic economic relations. Once students grasp the importance of marginal revenue and marginal costs, the process of economic optimization becomes intuitively obvious. In addition, a wide variety of examples and simple numerical problems vividly illustrate the application of managerial economics to a vast assortment of practical situations. By studying the material in FUNDAMENTALS OF MANAGERIAL ECONOMICS, 9e, those seeking to further their business careers learn how to more effectively collect, organize, and analyze information. They gain powerful tools that can help them become more successful--and satisfied--in their careers.</p><p>Mark Hirschey is the Anderson W.

An acquaintance from his youthful years in Paris, Terry McIver, is about to publish his autobiography. In its pages he accuses Barney of an assortment of sins, including murder. It's time, Barney decides, to present the world with his own version of events. <i>Barney's Version</i> is his memoir, a rambling, digressive rant, full of revisions and factual errors (corrected in footnotes written by his son) and enough insults for everyone, particularly vegetarians and Quebec separatists. <p> But Barney does get around to telling his life story, a desperately funny but sad series of bungled relationships. His first wife, an artist and poet, commits suicide and becomes--� la Sylvia Plath--a feminist icon, and Barney is widely reviled for goading her toward death, if not actually murdering her. He marries the second Mrs. Panofsky, whom he calls a "Jewish-Canadian Princess," as an antidote to the first; it turns out to be a horrible mistake. The third, "Miriam, my heart's desire," is quite possibly his soul mate, but Barney botches this one, too. It's painful to watch him ruin everything, and even more painful to bear witness to his deteriorating memory. The mystery at the heart of Barney's story--did he or did he not kill his friend Boogie?--provides enough forward momentum to propel the reader through endless digressions, all three wives, and every one of Barney's nearly heartbreaking episodes of forgetfulness. <i>Barney's Version</i>, winner of Canada's 1997 Giller Prize, is Richler's 10th novel, and a dense, energetic, and ultimately poignant read. <i>--R. Ellis</i></p>"Contains not a page without its laugh and not a paragraph without its smile...Richler is the funniest novelist at present at work in the English language."<br>--Francis King, The Spectator<br><br>"Like Dr. Johnson at his insulting best, Barney at the top of his form is unsurpassed...Richler has written a Lear for our selfish, penny-pinching times, a Lear uncluttered by divided kingdoms and quarreling daughters. Even the Fool is dispensed with. Barney is his own Fool."<br>--Alberto Manguel, Sunday Times<br><br>"Moving, funny, combative...What more could Booker judges and commentators---or anybody else--want from a novel?"<br>--James Walton, Daily Telegraph<br><br>"Exuberant, melancholy, literary outpouring from Richler at his best."<br>--Judy Cooke, Mail on Sunday<br><br>"The curmudgeonly, unregenerately boozy, caustic old rogue Barney Panofsky is Mordecai Richler's inspired antidote to political correctness, yoofiness, and all forms of contemporary smugness and pedantry...Richler is magisterially in command of his material."<br>--Katy Emick, The Guardian<br><br>"The funniest book of the year, and maybe the saddest...Mordecai Richler has never written with greater voice."<br>--Tom Adair, Scotland on Sunday</p><h2>Maps: Finding Our Place in the World</h2><p>Maps are universal forms of communication, easily understood and appreciated regardless of culture or language. This truly magisterial book introduces readers to the widest range of maps ever considered in one volume: maps from different time periods and a variety of cultures; maps made for divergent purposes and depicting a range of environments; and maps that embody the famous, the important, the beautiful, the groundbreaking, or the amusing. Built around the <i>functions</i> of maps&#x2014;the kinds of things maps do and have done&#x2014;<i>Maps</i> confirms the vital role of maps throughout history in commerce, art, literature, and national identity. <br><br>The book begins by examining the use of maps for wayfinding, revealing that even maps as common and widely used as these are the product of historical circumstances and cultural differences. The second chapter considers maps whose makers employed the smallest of scales to envision the broadest of human stages&#x2014;the world, the heavens, even the act of creation itself. The next chapter looks at maps that are, literally, at the opposite end of the scale from cosmological and world maps&#x2014;maps that represent specific parts of the world and provide a close-up view of areas in which their makers lived, worked, and moved.<br><br>Having shown how maps help us get around and make sense of our greater and lesser worlds, <i>Maps </i>then turns to the ways in which certain maps can be linked to particular events in history, exploring how they have helped Americans, for instance, to understand their past, cope with current events, and plan their national future. The fifth chapter considers maps that represent data from scientific instruments, population censuses, and historical records. These maps illustrate, for example, how diseases spread, what the ocean floor looks like, and how the weather is tracked and predicted. Next comes a turn to the imaginary, featuring maps that depict entire fictional worlds, from Hell to Utopia and from Middle Earth to the fantasy game <i>World of Warcraft</i>. The final chapter traces the origins of map consumption throughout history and ponders the impact of cartography on modern society.<br><br>A companion volume to the most ambitious exhibition on the history of maps ever mounted in North America, <i>Maps</i> will challenge readers to stretch conventional thought about what constitutes a map and how many different ways we can understand graphically the environment in which we live. Collectors, historians, mapmakers and users, and anyone who has ever &#x201c;gotten lost&#x201d; in the lines and symbols of a map will find much to love and learn from in this book.</p><p><b>James R.

R. R. Tolkien's Middle Earth, maps chart both physical and imaginary worlds. As geographer Denis Cosgrove explains '"World" is a social concept . . . a flexible term, stretching from physical environment to the world of ideas, microbes, of sin. Arguably, all these worlds can be mapped.' And they are in this compelling and very readable companion volume to the current exhibition at the Field Museum in Chicago." (<i>Discover</i>)<br><br>"What could be more straightforward than a map? It's information from the perceived world reduced to two dimensions. Oh, if it were only so simple. In <i>Maps: Finding Our Place in the World</i>, co-editor Robert W. Karrow Jr. wants to stretch our idea of 'mapness' to understand that maps chart not just geography but also culture and bias&#x2014;and can even obscure truth itself. The maps here are both beautiful and revelatory in the way they shape the viewer's thinking.

(Patrick T. Reardon <i>Chicago Tribune</i> 2007-12-30)<br><br>"Maps, say the co-editors of this extraordinary new book, are a form of communication, a universal language that transcends speech and culture. They are intuitively understood to serve as a historical archive of nothing less than mankind's progress in the world. And so, if you thought maps were merely aerial drawings of places that help us get from A to B, you will astonished by the depth and breadth of this book." (Nick Smith <i>BBC Focus Magazine</i> 2008-01-01)<br><br>"This is a fine work that belongs on the shelf of every serious student not just of the history of cartography but also of maps as socio-cultural artifacts. . . .

If I were to select a single work to teach a course on maps to a class whose familiarity with the subject ranged from knowledgeable to nil, I might well choose this one. . . . It contains such a wealth of information that advanced students would still learn a great deal, and it is written with sufficient clarity that beginners could understand it. Few books can make such a claim." (Hubert O. Johnson <i>The Portolan</i>)<br><br>"An enjoyable collection of high-standard essays. . . . The variety, quantity, and quality of illustrations (189, all in color) is truly exceptional for a non-catalogue.

Still acclaimed as one of the most remarkable and important motion pictures ever made, <i>2001: A Space Odyssey </i>depicted the first contacts between humanity and extraterrestrial intelligence. The movie was the product of a singular collaboration between Stanley Kubrick and science fiction visionary Arthur C. Clarke. Fresh off the success of his cold war satire <i>Dr. Strangelove, </i>Kubrick wanted to make the first truly first-rate science fiction film.

The first was James Joyce&#x2019;s Ulysses, which collapsed Odysseus&#x2019;s decade of wandering down to a single city, Dublin, and a seemingly arbitrary day, June 16, 1904. In Ulysses, the role of Ithaca&#x2019;s wily king was played by a commoner, Leopold Bloom&#x2014;a peaceable Jewish cuckold with an uncommonly fascinating inner life, one the author effectively allowed us to hear. Serialized from 1918 to 1920, it was published in full in 1922.<br> <br>The other was Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke&#x2019;s 2001: A Space Odyssey, in which the islands of the southeastern Mediterranean became the solar system&#x2019;s planets and moons, and the wine-dark sea the airless void of interplanetary, interstellar, and even intergalactic space.<br> <br>Shot in large-format panoramic 65-millimeter negative and initially projected on giant, curving Cinerama screens in specially modified theaters, 2001 premiered in Washington, DC, on April 2, 1968, and in New York City the following day. Produced and directed by Kubrick and conceived in collaboration with Clarke, one of the leading authors of science fiction&#x2019;s &#x201c;golden age,&#x201d; the film was initially 161 minutes long. Following a disastrous series of preview and premiere screenings, the director cut it down to a leaner 142 minutes.<br> <br>Where Joyce&#x2019;s strategy had been to transform Odysseus into a benevolently meditative cosmopolitan flaneur, and to reduce ten years of close calls and escape artistry to twenty-four hours in proximity of the River Liffey, Kubrick and Clarke took the opposite approach. Deploying science as a kind of prism, which during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries entirely transformed our sense of the size and duration of the universe, they vastly expanded Homer&#x2019;s spatiotemporal parameters. 2001: A Space Odyssey encompassed four million years of human evolution, from prehuman Australopithecine man-apes struggling to survive in southern Africa, through to twenty-first-century space-faring Homo sapiens, then on to the death and rebirth of their Odysseus astronaut, Dave Bowman, as an eerily posthuman &#x201c;Star Child.&#x201d; In the final scene, the weightless fetus returns to Earth as Richard Strauss&#x2019;s 1896 composition Thus Spoke Zarathustra pounds cathartically on the soundtrack.<br> <br>In 2001: A Space Odyssey, the meddlesome gods of the ancients have become an inscrutable, prying alien super-race. Never seen directly, they swoop down periodically from their galactic Olympus to intervene in human affairs. The instrument of their power, a rectangular black monolith, appears at key turning points in human destiny. First seen among starving man-apes in a parched African landscape at the &#x201c;Dawn of Man,&#x201d; 2001&#x2019;s totemic extraterrestrial artifact engenders the idea among our distant ancestors of using weaponized bones to harvest the animal protein grazing plentifully all around them. This prompting toward tool use implicitly channels the species toward survival, success&#x2014;and, eventually, technologically mediated global domination.<br> <br>After vaulting into that happy future in a match cut that has deservedly acquired the reputation of being the single most astonishing transition in cinematic history, 2001 leads us to understand that a lunar survey team has discovered another monolith, this one seemingly deliberately buried under the surface of the Moon eons before. When excavated and hit by sunlight for the first time in millions of years, it fires a powerful radio pulse in the direction of Jupiter&#x2014;evidently a signal, warning its makers that a species capable of space travel has arisen on Earth. A giant spacecraft, Discovery, is sent to investigate.<br> <br>While parallels with The Odyssey aren&#x2019;t as thoroughly woven into the structure of 2001 as they are in Ulysses, they certainly exist. Seemingly prodded into action by flawed programming, a cyclopean supercomputer named HAL-9000&#x2014;represented by an ultracalm disembodied voice and a network of individual glowing eyes positioned throughout Discovery&#x2014;goes bad and kills off most of the crew. The sole surviving astronaut, mission commander Dave Bowman, then has to fight the computer to the death. Apart from dueling a cybernetic Cyclops, Bowman&#x2019;s name references Odysseus, who returns to Ithaca, strings the bow of Apollo, shoots an arrow through twelve axe shafts, and proceeds to slaughter his wife&#x2019;s suitors. A nostos, or homecoming, was as necessary to Kubrick&#x2019;s and Clarke&#x2019;s Odyssey as it was to Homer&#x2019;s.<br> <br>Much like Joyce and in keeping with their expansive vision, 2001&#x2019;s authors took parallels with Homer as a starting point, not final word. When they began work in 1964, one initial motivation was to study the universal structures of all human myths. They were aided by Joseph Campbell&#x2019;s magisterial study The Hero with a Thousand Faces, which provided them with a template for the conscious creation of a new work of mythology. Early in their collaboration, Kubrick quoted a passage to Clarke concerning the universal rite of passage of any mythological hero, which Campbell suggested invariably encompasses &#x201c;separation&#x2013;initiation&#x2013;return.&#x201d; This tripartite structure &#x201c;might be named the nuclear unit of the monomyth,&#x201d; Campbell wrote&#x2014;a term he borrowed from Joyce, who&#x2019;d coined it in his last major work, Finnegans Wake.<br> <br>Campbell&#x2019;s research helped Kubrick and Clarke delve into the archetypal workings of human mythological yearnings, expanding that template to encompass not just one story and hero, and not even just one species, but rather the entire trajectory of humanity&#x2014;&#x201c;from ape to angel,&#x201d; as Kubrick put it in 1968. In this, they also overtly referenced Friedrich Nietzsche&#x2019;s 1891 philosophical novel Also sprach Zarathustra, with its concept of mankind as merely a transitional species&#x2014;sentient enough to understand its animal origins but not yet truly civilized. It was an idea both could get behind, Clarke with his innate optimism about human possibilities, and Kubrick with his deeply ingrained skepticism. It was this seemingly contradictory mesh of worldviews that gave 2001: A Space Odyssey its exhilarating fusion of agnosticism and belief, cynicism and idealism, death and rebirth.<br> <br>In Clarke, Kubrick had found the most balanced and productive creative partnership of his career. While the director made all the critical decisions during the film&#x2019;s production, the project started out&#x2014;and in important ways remained&#x2014;a largely equal collaboration between two very different, singularly creative characters. Like Joyce, both were expatriates, with the Kubrick family finally settling for good in England during the making of 2001, and Clarke being a resident of Ceylon&#x2014;later Sri Lanka&#x2014;from 1956 until his death in 2008.<br> <br>At 2001&#x2019;s release in 1968, Kubrick was thirty-nine, the same age as Joyce when Ulysses was being serialized. He was at the pinnacle of his abilities, having already made two of the twentieth century&#x2019;s great films. Each was a devastating indictment of human behavior as expressed through the military mind-set. Released in 1957, Paths of Glory served as a comprehensive indictment of the hypocrisy of the French general staff during World War I&#x2014;though its meanings were by no means limited to any one army or conflict. And his 1964 satire Dr. Strangelove, written in collaboration with Peter George and Terry Southern, cut to the core of the Cold War nuclear arms race, equal parts savage critique and caustic black comedy. A resounding critical and commercial success, it set the stage for the large-scale studio support necessary to realize 2001.<br> <br>Kubrick&#x2019;s method was to find an existing novel or source concept and adapt it for the screen, always stamping it with his own bleak&#x2014;but not necessarily despairing&#x2014;assessment of the human condition. A self-educated polymath, he was in some ways the ultimate genre director, switching virtuosically between established cinematic categories and forms with a restless analytical intelligence, always transcending and expanding their boundaries. During his career, he reinvented and redefined the film noir heist film, the war movie, the period costume feature, the horror flick, and the science fiction epic, each time transforming and reinvigorating the genre through extensive, time-consuming research followed by an uncompromising winnowing away of clich�s and extraneous elements.<br> <br>Kubrick treated every film as a grand investigation, drilling down into his subject with a relentless perfectionist&#x2019;s tenacity as he forced it to yield every secret and possibility. Once he&#x2019;d decided on a theme, he subjected it to years of interrogation, reading everything and exploring all aspects before finally jump-starting the cumbersome filmmaking machinery. Having concluded his preproduction research, he directed his pictures with all the authority of an enlightened despot. Following a stint as hired-gun director on Spartacus in 1960, he conceived of a personal kind of slave revolt, never again working on a project he didn&#x2019;t produce himself. While in practice, studios such as MGM footed the bills and exerted some influence, this gave him near-complete artistic independence. (Still Spartacus, which Kirk Douglas both produced and starred in, marked Kubrick&#x2019;s definitive induction into big-budget Hollywood filmmaking. The picture, which dramatized the bloody trajectory of a Thracian gladiator as he led a successful uprising against Rome, won four Oscars and a Golden Globe award for Best Motion Picture Drama.)<br> <br>As the ne plus ultra example of Kubrick&#x2019;s methods, 2001: A Space Odyssey wasn&#x2019;t just rooted in extensive preproduction fieldwork, it continued throughout&#x2014;an uninterrupted, well-funded research project spanning its live-action filming and extending across its postproduction as well (which, given the importance of its visual effects, was actually production by another name). All the while, the director and his team pioneered a variety of innovative new cinematic techniques. Highly unorthodox in big-budget filmmaking, this improvisatory, research-based approach was practically unheard of in a project of this scale. 2001 never had a definitive script. Major plot points remained in flux well into filming. Significant scenes were modified beyond recognition or tossed altogether as their moment on the schedule arrived. A documentary prelude featuring leading scientists discussing extraterrestrial intelligence was shot but discarded. Giant sets were built, found wanting, and rejected. A transparent two-ton Plexiglas monolith was produced at huge expense and then shelved as inadequate. And so forth.<br> <br>Throughout, Kubrick and Clarke remained locked in dialogue. One strategy they&#x2019;d agreed on in advance was that their story&#x2019;s metaphysical and even mystical elements had to be earned through absolute scientific-technical realism. 2001&#x2019;s space shuttles, orbiting stations, lunar bases, and Jupiter missions were thoroughly grounded in actual research and rigorously informed extrapolation, much of it provided by leading American companies then also busy providing technologies and expertise to the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or NASA. In late 1965, George Mueller, the czar of the Apollo lunar program, visited 2001&#x2019;s studio facilities north of London. Apollo was then still flight-testing unmanned launch vehicles, while NASA launched the precursor Gemini program&#x2019;s two-man capsules in an ambitious series of Earth-orbiting missions. After touring the film&#x2019;s emerging sets and viewing detailed scale models of its centrifuges and spacecraft, the man in charge of landing men on the Moon and returning them safely to Earth&#x2014;the ultimate Odyssean voyage yet accomplished by the species&#x2014;was impressed enough to dub the production &#x201c;NASA East.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clarke was fifty when 2001 came out. When Kubrick first contacted him early in 1964, he had already enjoyed an exceptionally prolific career. Best known as a formidably imaginative science fiction novelist and short-story writer, he was also a trenchant essayist and one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s leading advocates of human expansion into the solar system. Apart from his fictional and nonfictional output, he had played a noteworthy role in the history of technology. Clarke&#x2019;s 1945 paper on &#x201c;extraterrestrial relays,&#x201d; published in the British magazine Wireless World, proposed a global system of geostationary satellites, which, he argued, would revolutionize global telecommunications. While some of the ideas he presented had already been in circulation, he synthesized them impeccably, and the paper is regarded as an important document of the space age and the information revolution.<br> <br>Clarke&#x2019;s fictions were greatly influenced by the work of British science fiction novelist Olaf Stapledon (1886&#x2013;1950), whose seminal Last and First Men and Star Maker encompassed multiple phases of human evolution across vast timescales. Clarke&#x2019;s early novels Childhood&#x2019;s End (1953) and The City and the Stars (1956) likewise encompassed sweeps of time so expansive that monumental civilizational changes could be examined in great detail. Still considered his best work, Childhood&#x2019;s End closed with the human race being shepherded through an accelerated evolutionary transformation by a seemingly benevolent alien race, the &#x201c;Overlords.&#x201d; In it, humanity is depicted as obsolete&#x2014;destined for replacement by a telepathically linked successor species composed, oddly, of children. Clarke&#x2019;s strange vision of mankind outgrowing its childhood was also influenced directly by the great Russian rocket scientist and futurist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, who, in an essay published in 1912, stated, &#x201c;Earth is the cradle of the mind, but humanity can&#x2019;t remain in its cradle forever.&#x201d; As the central utopian credo of the space age, Tsiolkovsky&#x2019;s pronouncement would find direct expression in 2001&#x2019;s final scenes.<br> <br>As with Ulysses, 2001 was initially greeted with varying degrees of incomprehension, dismissal, and scorn&#x2014;but also awed admiration, particularly among the younger generation. Its first screenings were a harrowing ordeal, with audience reactions at the New York premiere including boos, catcalls, and large-scale walkouts. Most of the city&#x2019;s leading critics dismissed the film, some in personal and humiliating terms. And as with Joyce, some of Kubrick&#x2019;s and Clarke&#x2019;s peers went out of their way to disparage the film. Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky, possibly the greatest filmmaker of the twentieth century, found 2001 repellant. Calling it &#x201c;phony on many points,&#x201d; he argued that its fixation on &#x201c;the details of the material structure of the future&#x201d; resulted in a transformation of &#x201c;the emotional foundation of a film, as a work of art, into a lifeless schema with only pretensions to the truth.&#x201d; Soon after its release, Clarke&#x2019;s friend and fellow science fiction writer Ray Bradbury wrote a negative review decrying 2001&#x2019;s slow pace and banal dialogue. He had a solution, though: it should be &#x201c;run through the chopper, heartlessly.&#x201d;<br> <br>In retrospect, these initial waves of hostility and incomprehension can be understood as a result of the film&#x2019;s radical innovations in technique and structure&#x2014;another similarity to Ulysses. They were followed by grudging reappraisals, at least on the part of some, and a dawning understanding that a truly significant work of...</p><h2>Study Guide for Book Clubs: Where the Crawdads Sing (Study Guides for Book Clubs)</h2><p><b> An essential tool for all reading groups, this guide provides a detailed analysis of Delia Owens's bestselling novel, 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. <b></b> Covering a wealth of information it includes thirty thought-provoking discussion questions; a detailed plot summary; useful literary context; an author biography; themes &amp; imagery; character breakdowns; recommended further reading and even a quick quiz.Guaranteed to spark productive discussion, this companion guide takes the hard work out of preparing for your book group meeting.

The discussion throughout is informed by recent developments in philosophy of science. Authors D. C. Phillips and Nicholas C. Burbules cite a number of interesting examples from the educational research and evaluation literature to illustrate the value of a scientific approach. Many educational researchers aspire to carry out rigorous or disciplined inquiry aimed at producing accurate (and generally &#39;truthful&#39;) accounts of educational phenomena and the causal psychological or social processes that lay behind them. However, many recent critics have argued that it is a mistake to believe that research can yield theories, or advance claims that are true, objective, and value-neutral. In other words, that researchers always work within frameworks that embody important (and often questionable) assumptions about values and the nature of human knowledge. This book argues that , while there is much to be learned from recent critiques, traditional scientific values and assumptions are not outmoded. The authors show students how to implement and benefit from the scientific method in ways that take into account recent critiques.</p><p><b>D. C.

Burbules</b> is professor of education at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. He is also editor of the journal <i>Educational Theory</i>.At last an engaging and well-reasoned defense of scientific rationality. This is a powerful antidote to the myriad critics who disparage or dismiss the social sciences. (David C. Berliner, Regents' Professor Emeritus, Arizona State University)<br><br>This book is a must-read for all who are concerned with the mission and nature of educational research. (Gavriel Salomon, University of Haifa, Israel)<br><br>Phillips and Burbules, two leading philosophers of education, have produced a much needed examination of just how far the possibility for social science has been undercut by critiques intended to undercut the credibility of scientific knowledge. Their clearly written book will help educational researchers understand how effective, disciplined research is possible in a post-positivist world. The authors systematically examine the problems created by the fallibility of knowledge, the inevitable value-ladenness of research, and the existence of varying perspectives, showing how the pursuit of truth can remain a reasonable activity. The book should be required reading for those learning to do educational research, filling the gap between how-to books on research method and post-positivist accounts that embrace, or at least flirt with, relativism. By blending careful argument with concrete examples, Phillips and Burbules help students recognize the limits of research without abandoning the quest for warranted claims to knowledge. (Robert E.

A protest against the passive, insipid 19th-century heroine, Lady Audley was described by one critic of the time as "high-strung, full of passion, purpose, and movement." Her crime (the secret of the title) is shown to threaten the apparently respectable middle-class world of Victorian England.</p><p><p> <em>Lady Audley&#x2019;s Secret</em> (1862) was one of the most widely read novels in the Victorian period. The novel exemplifies &#x201c;sensation fiction&#x201d; in featuring a beautiful criminal heroine, an amateur detective, blackmail, arson, violence, and plenty of suspenseful action. To its contemporary readers, it also offered the thrill of uncovering blackmail and criminal violence within the homes of the upper class. The novel makes trenchant critiques of Victorian gender roles and social stereotypes, and it creates significant sympathy for the heroine, despite her criminal acts, as she suffers from the injustices of the &#x201c;marriage market&#x201d; and rebels against them. </p> <p> This Broadview edition includes a critical introduction and a broad selection of primary source material, including reproductions of the twenty-two woodcut illustrations from the <em>London Journal</em> serialization of the novel, extracts from two Victorian dramatizations of the work, satirical commentaries, and contemporary reviews. </p>Edited by David Skilton, Professor of English at UWIST, Cardiff</p><h2>The Door in the Sky</h2><p><p>Ananda K. Coomaraswamy (1877-1947) was a pioneer in Indian art history and in the cultural confrontation of East and West. A scholar in the tradition of the great Indian grammarians and philosophers, an art historian convinced that the ultimate value of art transcends history, and a social thinker influenced by William Morris, Coomaraswamy was a unique figure whose works provide virtually a complete education in themselves. Finding a universal tradition in past cultures ranging from the Hellenic and Christian to the Indian, Islamic, and Chinese, he collated his ideas and symbols of ancient wisdom into the sometimes complex, always rewarding pattern of essays. <i>The Door in the Sky</i> is a collection of the author's writings on myth drawn from his <i>Metaphysics</i> and <i>Traditional Art and Symbolism</i>, both originally published in Bollingen Series.

In this volume, Professor Hayden Pelliccia has revised Jowett's renderings of five key dialogues, giving us a modern Plato faithful to both Jowett's best features and Plato's own masterly style.<br><br>Gathered here are many of Plato's liveliest and richest texts. Ion takes up the question of poetry and introduces the Socratic method. Protagoras discusses poetic interpretation and shows why cross-examination is the best way to get at the truth. Phaedrus takes on the nature of rhetoric, psychology, and love, as does the famous Symposium. Finally, Apology gives us Socrates' art of persuasion put to the ultimate test--defending his own life.<br><br>Pelliccia's new Introduction to this volume clarifies its contents and addresses the challenges of translating Plato freshly and accurately. In its combination of accessibility and depth, Selected Dialogues of Plato is the ideal introduction to one of the key thinkers of all time.</p><p>"Plato is philosophy, and philosophy, Plato."<br>--Ralph Waldo Emerson<b>Dr. Hayden Pelliccia</b> is associate professor and chair of classics at Cornell University. <br><br><b>Plato </b>(c. 428 B.C. -- 347 B.C.) was a student of Socrates.

Unfortunately, this robot is very particular about the details. It can't simply collect a rare type of bacteria from a volcano. It needs step-by-step instructions on where to go, how to collect the bacteria, what bacteria to collect, and how to get back to the Explorers. Even more unfortunately, the Explorers are superbusy folks with a lot of cool stuff on their minds. That means they rarely give Cody the instructions it needs, which makes it want to totally short-circuit.

Encompassing the period from Rome's founding in the eighth century B.C. through Justinian's rule in the sixth century A.D., he offers a distinctive perspective on the Romans and their civilization by employing fundamental Roman values as a lens through which to view both their rise and spectacular fall.</p><p>Interweaving social, political, religious, and cultural history, Martin interprets the successes and failures of the Romans in war, political organization, quest for personal status, and in the integration of religious beliefs and practices with government. He focuses on the central role of social and moral values in determining individual conduct as well as decisions of state, from monarchy to republic to empire. Striving to reconstruct ancient history from the ground up, he includes frequent references to ancient texts and authors, encouraging readers to return to the primary sources.

First, thanks for reminding me why I entered this profession. The last few years have been frustrating for me, mainly because I have been torn between the science and the practice of business. While my experiences at Wichita State and here at Chico have been valuable, I have not done a very good job of integrating the two. Your book is reminding me why good social science really adds value to the practice of business, entrepreneurship included.</p><p></p><p>Second, your anecdotes are fabulous. They are reminding me that the real payoff of our profession is the ability to exchange ideas with other smart people. I have to say that one thing I have done well over the past few years is to learn from people who know more than I do.</p><p>You, Ed, Maureen Ambrose, and Joe Rosse are just some examples. I think the best example you gave of the never-ending process of learning was your encounter with Chris Argyris. I about split my sides on reading that one.</p><p></p><p>Third, and this is what qualifies my reading of the book as a "critical incident," it primed me for my interview at Illinois State. Though I knew before I went that I wanted a position that afforded me more time and resources for research, I was able to see the big picture much more clearly. My research presentation was the best I have ever made. I felt like I knew my stuff and that while I have been less focused the past few years than I would like, I had actually done a pretty good job of preparing for my next career phase. Your book was the final trigger I needed.</p><p></p><p>So, all of this figures in some "resolutions" on my part. Number one, scholarship is now my professional priority. When I do practice it will be with an eye toward furthering our knowledge of entrepreneurship.</p><p>Number two, you have taught me the value of fast turnaround time. I have resolved that when I am working with others, they will get manuscripts and correspondence back as fast as you get them back to me.</p><p>(I do realize how challenging that goal is, by the way.)</p><p></p><p>This Monday morning finds me optimistic. I believe I have a very good chance of landing that job and there is every indication that it is exactly where I need to be to accomplish my professional and personal goals.

In their immediacy and vibrancy, photographs from the Hubble show what future generations of space travelers might see should they venture beyond our solar system. But their brilliant hues and precise details are not simply products of the telescope&#x2019;s unprecedented orbital location and technologically advanced optical system. Rather, they result from a series of deliberate decisions made by the astronomers who convert raw data from the Hubble into spectacular pictures by assigning colors, adjusting contrast, and actively composing the images, balancing the desire for an aesthetically pleasing representation with the need for a scientifically valid one.</p><p>In <i>Picturing the Cosmos</i>, Elizabeth A. Kessler examines the Hubble&#x2019;s deep space images, highlighting the remarkable resemblance they bear to nineteenth-century paintings and photographs of the American West and their invocation of the visual language of the sublime. Drawing on art history and the history of science, as well as interviews with astronomers who work on the Hubble Heritage Project, Kessler traces the ways that the sublime, with its inherent tension between reason and imagination, not only forms the appearance of the images, but also operates on other levels. The sublime informs the dual expression&#x2014;numeric and pictorial&#x2014;of digital data and underpins the relevance of the frontier for a new era of exploration performed by our instruments rather than our bodies. Through their engagement with the sublime the Hubble images are a complex act of translation that encourages an experience of the universe as simultaneously beyond humanity&#x2019;s grasp and within the reach of our knowledge.</p><p>Strikingly illustrated with full-color images, this book reveals the scientific, aesthetic, and cultural significance of the Hubble pictures, offering a nuanced understanding of how they shape our ideas&#x2014;and dreams&#x2014;about the cosmos and our places within it.<br><br></p></p><p><p>Elizabeth A. Kessler teaches art history at Stanford University.</p>Since its celebrated launch into orbit in 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope has yielded a cornucopia of observational data that has immeasurably benefited the fields of astronomy and cosmology. The strikingly detailed, colorful photos of whirling galaxies and murky nebulae have also captured the public&#x2019;s imagination and sparked renewed enthusiasm for space exploration. According to Kessler, an authority on the visual culture of science, much of this &#x201c;special effects&#x201d; exhibitionism has been deliberate, as astronomers working for the Hubble Heritage Project have used computers to manipulate hue and contrast to create awe-inspiring images. Kessler looks over the shoulders of the project&#x2019;s team leaders and describes the decision-making processes behind producing photos that are both aesthetically pleasing and scientifically accurate. Perhaps the biggest surprise here is how closely the team adheres to romantic notions of grandeur, with pictures often resembling the sweeping vistas produced by Ansel Adams. While Kessler&#x2019;s work won&#x2019;t replace those heavy coffee-table astronomy books that showcase Hubble&#x2019;s best imagery, it will make readers more fully appreciate just what they&#x2019;re looking at. --Carl Hays</p><h2>The Evil That Men Do: FBI Profiler Roy Hazelwood&#39;s Journey into the Minds of Sexual Predators</h2><p>A founder of VICAP, the FBI program that profiles serial killers, offers his expertise and insights concerning the way the minds of sexual criminals work and examines such cases as the Atlanta child murderer and the &#34;Barbie and Ken&#34; case. 25,000 first printing.</p><p><i>The Evil That Men Do</i> profiles the profilers--the investigators who study crimes to try to figure out how, why, and by whom crimes were committed. The focus is on veteran profiler Roy Hazelwood, who played an important role in the growing legitimacy of the art and science of psychological profiling, often seen by police forces as a questionable practice. Through his chillingly accurate profiles and his ability to predict criminal behavior, as well as his keen and creative logical reasoning, Hazelwood has proven himself not only to the law enforcement professionals who use his services but to the public at large. <p> Michaud doesn't approach his subject gingerly. While the profilers are treated like regular guys with a really weird job, the crime descriptions can be nauseatingly graphic. Although some of the accounts <i>are</i> funny, this is primarily a disturbing glimpse at some of the most deranged and violent people modern society has produced. <i>--Lisa Higgins</i></p>Praise for <i>The Evil That Men Do</i>:<p> "Take it from me: Roy's insights and experience prove that he is an expert in crime analysis. The story he has to tell is well worth listening to." --John Douglas, author of <i>Mindhunter</i></p><p> "This book tells it all." --Robert K. Ressler, author of <i>I Have Lived in the Monster</i> and <i>Whoever Fights Monsters</i></p><p> "Hazelwood's authentic and unique perspective pierces a darkness most of us would like to believe doesn't exist." --Chris Carter, creator of <i>The X-Files</i></p><p> "Nobody knows this territory better than Roy Hazelwood. He was first to explore the world of sexual predators, and charted it with an accuracy and insight that those of us who followed after have used for guidance ever since. In this outstanding book, Hazelwood takes us all with him into the belly of the beast--and more important, into the mind of the beast." --Linda A. Fairstein, chief of the Sex Crimes Prosecution Unit, Manhattan District Attorney's Office</p><p> "When the world's best true-crime writer teams with the world's best sex crimes profiler, they produce a book that should have a warning label, 'DO NOT READ ALONE AT NIGHT.' This is a textbook for the law enforcement and forensic-science professional and a compelling description of extremely dangerous people that the lay reader will not be able to put down." --Dr. Lowell Levine, director of the Medicolegal Investigations Unit, New York State Police</p><p> "As an experienced forensic scientist, I knew the material was not new, but as a woman, I locked the doors and drew the drapes. The actions and thought processes of the criminals described in this book will completely unnerve ALL women. It is scarier than any horror fiction because it is real." --Cathryn L. Levine, M.S., M.A., Fellow, American Board of Criminalistics, New York State Police</p><p> "Star profiler Roy Hazelwood and true-crime guru Stephen G. Michaud--what a combination! For criminologists and crime buffs alike, they have produced the book of the year." --Jack Olsen, author of <i>Salt of the Earth</i> and <i>Hastened to the Grave</i></p><p> "Once again author Stephen G. Michaud showcases his remarkable talent for taking the reader deep into the twisted and all-too-real world of criminal behavior. <i>The Evil That Men Do</i> rings out like a warning shot to potential crime victims everywhere." --Carlton Stowers, author of <i>To the Last Breath</i></p></p><h2>Mathematical Excursions, Enhanced Edition, 3rd</h2><p>MATHEMATICAL EXCURSIONS, Third Edition, teaches students that mathematics is a system of knowing and understanding our surroundings.

He lives in East Setauket, NY.Meyers, professor emeritus of radiology and internal medicine at SUNY&#x2013;Stony Brook, has a simple message: the most significant breakthroughs in medical research usually came about when people were looking for something else entirely. Lithium's effect on bipolar disorder, for example, was discovered because a scientist was taking advantage of its solubility to run toxicity tests on patients. Likewise, Viagra was developed during experiments on medications designed to treat angina. Meyers has dozens of stories like this, in the areas of antibiotics, cancer treatments, cardiovascular therapy and antidepressants. The anecdotes are lively and filled with miniportraits of important doctors like Paul Ehrlich (who pioneered the use of chemistry to develop medical treatments) and Arthur Voorhees (who stumbled onto the treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysms), but some chapters feel forcefully wedged in. The role of accident in creating the thalidomide molecule is glossed in one sentence, and too little information is given about contemporary research into the therapeutic use of LSD to draw any meaningful conclusions (although it's a good excuse to revisit the story of Albert Hofmann's bicycle ride). But it will be hard to argue with Meyers's criticism of a rigid scientific culture that discourages experimenters from keeping an eye out for the unexpected.<i> (Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Over the next two decades he exhibited works by Dal�, Ernst, Joseph Cornell, Calder, Eugene Berman, Tchelitchew, Giacometti, Arshile Gorky and many other luminaries of twentieth-century art, giving a number of them their first shows. But Levy was more than a gifted dealer: he also had a gift for friendship, and in this charming, anecdotal memoir he recounts his intimate dealings with some of the most innovative figures of his generation. He crossed the Atlantic with Duchamp and introduced Tanguy to New York. He conceived the idea for Dal�'s <i>Birth of Venus</i> pavilion at the World's Fair, shared a summer house with Ernst and fished with Andr� Breton (yielding a memorable description of the Surrealist leader's run-in with a blowfish). And he was with Gorky in the final, tragic days before the painter's suicide. <i>Memoir of an Art Gallery</i> is the story of prescient vision and lifelong devotion. By turns humorous and moving, and back in print after many years, it is also one of the most enjoyable works ever written about the pivotal time when Manhattan became the art capital of the world.

Over the course of eighteen shows, Mordden demonstrates that Sondheim is a classical composer who happens to write musicals. Sondheim has intellectualized the musical by tackling serious content usually reserved for the spoken stage: nonconformism (in <em>Anyone Can Whistle</em>, 1964), history (in <em>Pacific Overtures</em>, 1976), and cannibalism as a metaphor for class warfare (<em>Sweeney</em> <em>Todd</em>, 1979). Yet his work combines complex music and intellectual plots with a masterly skill for the fabric of theatre. His shows are all intensely theatrical, produced with flair and brilliance, whether in the lush operetta of <em>A Little Night Music </em>(1973) or the quixotic fairy-tale magic of <em>Into</em> <em>the Woods</em> (1987). <br><br>Mordden provides fresh insights and analyses of every Sondheim show, from his first hit (<em>West Side Story</em>, 1957) to his most recent title (<em>Road Show</em>, 2008). Each musical has a dedicated chapter, including articles on Sondheim's life and his major influences, and comprehensive bibliographical and discographical essays place the Sondheim literature and recordings in perspective. Writing with his usual blend of the scholarly and the popular - with a wicked sense of humor - Ethan Mordden reveals why Stephen Sondheim has become Broadway's most significant voice in the last fifty years.<br></p><p><br><strong>Ethan Mordden</strong> has long been recognized as an authority on the American musical, and is the author of such books as <em>Anything Goes: A History of American Musical Theater</em>, <em>Make Believe: The Broadway Musical in the 1920s</em>, <em>Beautiful Mornin': The Broadway Musical in the 1940s</em>, and <em>Coming Up Roses: The</em> <em>Broadway Musical in the 1950s</em>.

The chapters are written by experts, but designed to be accessible to students who may be unfamiliar with Old English. The emphasis throughout is on placing texts in their contemporary context and suggesting ways in which they relate to each other and to the important events and issues of the time. With the help of maps and a chronological table of events the first chapters describe briefly the political, social and ecclesiastical history of the period and how poetry and prose in Latin and in the vernacular developed and flourished. A succinct account of Old English provides beginners with a handy guide to the rules of spelling, grammar and syntax. Subsequent chapters explore the range of Anglo-Saxon writing under different thematic headings. A final bibliography gives guidance on further reading.</p><p>A collection of fifteen specially commissioned essays introduces students to the literature of Anglo-Saxon England from 600-1066.

Health care, schools, Social Security, public lands, the military, prisons&#x2014;all are considered fair game. Through stories, analysis, impassioned argument&#x2014;even song lyrics&#x2014;Si Kahn and Elizabeth Minnich show that corporations are, by their very nature, unable to fulfill effectively what have traditionally been the responsibilities of government.

For forty-five of my almost sixty-six years, I&#x2019;ve made my living as a professional civil rights, labor, and community organizer.<br><br> It was my great good fortune to begin my organizing career as a volunteer with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), the militant student wing of the Southern Civil Rights Movement. SNCC (pronounced &#x201c;SNICK&#x201d;) was nothing if not creative. Drawing on old traditions of African American resistance, shaped by veterans of the civil rights, labor, and peace movements, it developed not only ways of thinking about how community organizing can change the world for the better, but also strategies to make that real in the world. The great movements of the last forty-five years&#x2014;among them those of women, workers, welfare recipients, peace lovers, students, lesbian, bisexual, gay, transgender and queer/questioning activists, union members, and environmentalists&#x2014;would not have been what they were without the influence and lessons of the Southern Civil Rights Movement.<br><br> Most organizers spend their entire hard-working lives without ever being lucky enough to take part in a campaign or movement that gets noted by history. I have had the great good fortune to have been involved with five of them: In the 1960s, I joined the Southern Civil Rights Movement. In the 1970s and early 1980s, I was involved in the Brookside Strike, led by the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) in Harlan County, Kentucky; the J. P. Stevens Campaign for unionization in the southern textile mills, led by the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU); and the Brown Lung Movement, in which cotton mill workers disabled by the deadly disease known medically as byssinosis fought for compensation and to clean up the mills. Since the mid-1990s, Grassroots Leadership, the organization I&#x2019;ve worked for over the last thirty years, has led the national campaign to abolish all for-profit private prisons, jails, and detention centers, and to put an end to immigrant family detention, the appalling recent practice in which children as young as infants are imprisoned together with their parents.<br><br> I don&#x2019;t deal with all these campaigns and movements in this book. Rather, I&#x2019;ve chosen to write the way my grandmothers cooked, &#x201c;a little of this, a little of that,&#x201d; to create a smorgasbord rather than a history, either of organizing or of my own life and work.<br><br> As with any trade, there is an established way to do community organizing, basic principles and skills that you&#x2019;ll find in any organizer&#x2019;s toolbox. A number of handbooks and strategy manuals lay all of this out, including my own earlier books How People Get Power and Organizing: A Guide for Grassroots Leaders. Pick up any of them, and you&#x2019;ll learn the common wisdom of generations of organizers, along with the shoptalk of the trade: one-on-ones, door knocking, strategy sessions, shift meetings, tactics, actions, accountability sessions, free media, negotiations.<br><br> That&#x2019;s not what this book is about. Rather, it deals with creative variations on the general theme of organizing. What distinguished the campaigns and movements in which I was involved was their creativity. I&#x2019;ve spent my working life learning from the best&#x2014;literally hundreds of civil rights, labor, and community organizers who brought not just passion and courage but great freshness and innovation to everything they did.<br><br> That&#x2019;s why this book is titled Creative Community Organizing. It&#x2019;s a tribute to all of the wonderful organizers with whom I&#x2019;ve worked and shared stories over these forty-five years, a praise song to the traditions of activism and resistance we share, and that we work to pass on to the next generations of &#x201c;rabble-rousers, activists, and quiet lovers of justice.&#x201d;<br><br> Because I&#x2019;m not just an organizer, but also a historian, songwriter, and storyteller, I believe that a straight line is often the longest distance between two points. It&#x2019;s true that, as the saying goes, &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t know where you&#x2019;re going, any road will get you there.&#x201d;<br><br> But even if you have a clear destination in mind, it doesn&#x2019;t necessarily follow that the best way to get there is the shortest. You&#x2019;ll find that attitude reflected in the winding road that is this book, with lots of detours and side trips along the way. But, as creative community organizers, we do know where we&#x2019;re going&#x2014; and we will get there.<br><br> In my own work as an organizer, I&#x2019;ve tried to &#x201c;keep my eyes on the prize,&#x201d; to stay focused on the goal, the victory that will give the people I&#x2019;m working with changes for the better that they can see and feel. But I&#x2019;m also concerned with what people learn on the way to that victory: about themselves, each other, history, justice, community, friendship. I want them to love the struggle for justice, not endure it.<br><br> So I&#x2019;ve written this book the way I organize. Think of creative community organizing as a highway leading to somewhere you passionately want to go, but with lots of interesting side roads and paths to explore along the way. When in the course of this book you hit a song, a story, a poem, a bit of oral history, think of it as a chance to turn off the main drag for a little while, to rest yourself from the journey, to feel as well as to think.<br><br> As a historian, I tend to pay attention to the path behind as well as the road ahead. Because I want history to be accessible to a wide range of people who have different relationships to reading, I&#x2019;ve used songs in my organizing as a way to tell stories. I am always moved and inspired when everyday people decide not just to read history but to make it, so it&#x2019;s their stories that so many of my songs are about.<br><br> The lyrics you&#x2019;ll encounter are taken from songs I wrote. If someone else wrote one of the poems or songs that salt the book, I&#x2019;ll tell you in the text who they are.<br><br> Why did I write this book? Almost every day, I encounter people who have a passionate desire to make a difference in the world, to do whatever it takes to change it for the better. Like the phototropic plants that grow towards the light, they lean towards doing what is right, often at considerable risk and cost. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said that &#x201c;the arc of the moral universe . . . bends towards justice.&#x201d; So do individual people&#x2014;and they are the salt of the earth.<br><br> My greatest hope is that when one of these natural-born activists says to someone who&#x2019;s been organizing for years, &#x201c;So do you think I should become an organizer?&#x201d; they&#x2019;ll tell them about this book and say, &#x201c;Read it, then come back and talk with me.&#x201d;<br><br> I can&#x2019;t tell you whether you should become an organizer, full time or volunteer, although I hope many of you who read Creative Community Organizing will decide it&#x2019;s something that makes sense for you. I will just say that I cannot imagine any work that would have given me a better life and a stronger sense of having done my best to make a difference, not just for those with whom I&#x2019;ve worked, but for myself.<br><br> As Mother Jones says in the song, &#x201c;Whether I chose right or wrongly, I was there.&#x201d;</p><h2>Approaches to Social Research</h2><p>Thoroughly revised and updated, the fourth edition of this successful text offers a wealth of new research examples and references, accessible diagrams of essential concepts and processes, and extended coverage of core methods and recent developments. Striking a balance between specific techniques and the underlying logic of scientific inquiry, <em>Approaches to Social Research, Fourth Edition</em>, provides a lucid treatment of the four major approaches to research--experimentation, survey research, field research, and the use of available data. While advocating a multiple-methods strategy that treats these approaches as complementary rather than mutually exclusive, the book contains a detailed account of the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. <br> Opening chapters draw students into the subject by illustrating the practicality of the study of research methods and outlining the scientific foundations of social research. The text then follows a typical research project, beginning with research design, measurement, and sampling. It proceeds with data collection and concludes with data processing and analysis. This fourth edition includes new and revised chapters that address the role of emerging technologies and the Internet in social research. Extensively updated research examples and a clear exposition make complex issues accessible to students with no background in social research. <em>Approaches to Social Research, Fourth Edition</em>, is an ideal textbook for graduates and advanced undergraduates in the social sciences, and it also provides important guidance for researchers in sociology and related disciplines.</p><p>Royce A.

This is a major departure from the intricate science fiction tales Williams usually writes (<i>City on Fire</i>, <i>Aristoi</i>), but he applies the same thoroughness, complexity, and great character development to this disaster yarn. Some readers might balk at the book's size (it's a doorstopper), but consider the subject: the biggest earthquake in recorded history, a monstrous disaster that lays waste to entire cities from Chicago to New Orleans, flings one of the world's largest rivers out of its banks, and within 10 minutes obliterates countless lives. But the earthquake is only the beginning of this horror story--fire, flood, and chaos follow, and ordinary people are pushed to the limits of ability and sanity as they are transformed into <i>survivors</i>: <p> </p><blockquote> Marcy thought the tremor was just another aftershock, but then she saw the flash brighten the shining steel of the Gateway Arch, and turned south to watch in awestruck horror as the bright fireball rose over south St. Louis. Bright arching trails of flame shot out of the fireball, like Fourth of July rockets, as debris rose and fell.... <i>It is the Bomb</i>, Marcy thought. <i>It is the End</i>.... The bubble of fire rose into the heavens, and its reflection turned the Mississippi to the color of blood. </blockquote><p> Williams follows the fates of nine people in the earthquake's aftermath. Among the most compelling, considering the racial and political tension characteristic of the American southeast, are the stories of sheriff Omar Paxton, a card-carrying KKK member from a small parish in Louisiana; the Reverend Noble Frankland, a fundamentalist preacher with well-stocked bunkers and fanatic followers; and General Jessica Frazetta of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the woman in charge of somehow repairing the damage. Each character's story would make a terrifying disaster novel on its own, and Williams handles them all deftly, weaving their threads through the apocalyptic postquake landscape. <i>The Rift</i> is a magnitude 9 novel--you'll walk gingerly on the quiet earth when you're done reading. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>Walter John Williams is the author of 11 previous SF and fantasy novels and one story collection. He lives in New Mexico.</p><h2>Exodus 1-18 (The Anchor Yale Bible Commentaries)</h2><p><p>Exodus is the heart of the Hebrew Bible, the defining moment in Israel&#x2019;s birth as a people, the dramatic triumph of their God. Yahweh, Pharaoh, Moses, Aaron, the Hebrew slaves, the plagues, the parting of the Red Sea&#x2015;these larger-than-life characters and epoch-making events capture the imagination of everyone from biblical scholars to moviemakers. However, the meaning and significance, the beauty and nuance, of this captivating biblical book are lost unless we have a world-class Scripture scholar to open our eyes to its riches.<br>In Exodus 1&#x2013;18, William H. C. Propp translates the original text in all its grandeur, then provides a masterful exploration and analysis of the book&#x2019;s first eighteen chapters. Here the fate of the Hebrew slaves hangs in the balance of the dramatic conflict between the God of Israel and the Pharaoh of Egypt. From the discovery of Moses in a basket made of bulrushes to the story of the Burning Bush, from the ten plagues visited upon Egypt by God to water from the rock and quail and manna from the skies, Exodus is filled with the miraculous and the dramatic. <br>Doubleday is proud to be publishing the long-awaited first of two volumes of the Anchor Bible Commentary on Exodus.

During third grade, as they increase their knowledge about words (including the concepts of syllables, prefixes, and suffixes), they put that knowledge to work, decoding unfamiliar multisyllabic words. If a child has not mastered the skill of decoding simple words, that practice should continue.<br><br> By third grade, the mental process of turning letters into sounds should be nearly automatic. This year, children focus more on meaning as they read. Their reading vocabulary expands tremendously, as does their ability to read longer and more complex literature. They read for information and begin to use nonfiction reference books like children&#x2019;s dictionaries and encyclopedias. They learn the distinction between fiction and nonfiction, and they read and enjoy longer and more complicated &#x201c;chapter books.&#x201d;<br><br> In third grade, children continue to learn about language as they write it: identifying parts of speech, properly using punctuation, and recognizing sentence types. They begin to shape their own writing, understanding how paragraphs relate in a larger whole and exerting more control over vocabulary and structure.<br><br> Parents can do many things to help their children reach these new levels of understanding language:<br><br> �Read aloud to your child. While third graders are beginning to read on their own, they also still enjoy listening. Continue reading aloud, both fiction and nonfiction, even as your child becomes an independent reader.<br><br> �Have your child read aloud to you. Build your child&#x2019;s ability to read independently by encouraging her to read poems and stories aloud.

We hope you&#x2019;ll take it as a starting point in your search for more literature for your child to read and enjoy.<br><br> We have included both traditional and modern poetry. Poems can be silly, written for the sheer enjoyment of rhythm and rhyme, or they can be serious. Rhythm and rhyme make poetry the perfect literature for a third grader to memorize.<br><br> The stories selected here include classic folktales from many cultures and excerpts from great works of children&#x2019;s literature. Some of them have been chosen as literary links to topics elsewhere in the book. In the case of book-length works, we can provide only short excerpts, hoping that you and your child will read the rest on your own.<br><br> This book continues the effort, begun in previous books, to share the wealth of classical mythology. Because third graders learn about ancient Rome, several myths were chosen to convey a sense of Roman history. Likewise, we offer some Norse mythology. Parents can coordinate readings about literature and history. Age-old myths also give parents the opportunity to discuss traditional virtues such as friendship, courage, and honesty.</p><h2>The Complete Alice: with the Original Illustrations by Sir John Tenniel in Full Colour</h2><p><p>There are many editions of <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>, but none to rival <i>The Complete Alice</i>, a gorgeous new gift book celebrating one hundred and fifty years of Alice.</p><p>In 1865, Macmillan published the first edition of Lewis Carroll's <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>, widely acknowledged as one of the most influential children's books of all time. Its equally famous sequel, <i>Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There</i>, was published in 1872. </p><p><i>The Complete Alice </i>brings together Lewis Carroll's two extraordinary stories in a single glorious volume. The original artwork has been lovingly restored. Both texts are complete and unabridged, including the rarely seen "deleted" episode <i>The Wasp in a Wig</i>. Also included is <i>The Story of Alice</i>, an exclusive sixteen-page account of the creation and first publication of <i>Alice</i>, told for younger readers and featuring material from Macmillan's rich historical archive. A foreword from Philip Pullman introduces this truly special gift edition.</p></p><p><p><b>Lewis Carroll </b>was the pen-name of Charles Ludwidge Dodgson. Born in 1832, Dodgson was a mathematics tutor at Christ Church College, Oxford. In addition to his famous children's stories, his published work included poetry, puzzles, mathematical treaties, and essays on subjects as wide-ranging as tennis and the art of writing letters. </p><p><b>Sir John Tenniel </b>was already a renowned cartoonist when he was invited to produce illustrations for <i>Alice</i>. His exquisite engravings are among the most iconic and best loved images in the world. </p><p><b>Philip Pullman</b> is one of today's most highly aclaimed writers for children. Best known for the multi-award winning His Dark Materials trilogy, he lives and writes in Oxford, the city where <i>Alice </i>was created.</p></p><h2>Hitler&#39;s Uranium Club: The Secret Recordings at Farm Hall</h2><p>September 1939: The Third Reich launches the first military research effort into the viability of producing atomic weapons. For the project, the Nazis bring together an elite team of German scientists, who call themselves "The Uranium Club."<br>For students of World War II or the atomic age, or anyone fascinated by the intertwining of science and politics, Hitler's Uranium Club provides an opportunity rare in recorded history: the chance to eavesdrop on pivotal figures in history as they complete one era, come to terms with it, and prepare their strategy for the next. As noted science historian David Cassidy writes in his introduction, "It is as though these men were lifted out of history at a crucial turning point - from the age of conventional weapons to the nuclear era - placed within a timeless container, and told to discuss their past and future as the recorders roll."</p><p>Jeremy Bernstein has been a professor of physics at the Stevens Institute of Technology since 1967.Upon hearing about the Hiroshima bomb, the German nuclear physicists were astounded, and voluble about figuring out how the weapon worked. Their reactions were secretly taped, and after 50 years, their conversations about nuclear physics and Nazi politics were released. This, their first book-form appearance, broadly consists of Bernstein's summary of prewar physics and the German nuclear research program (including a turning-point, 1942 Heisenberg lecture to Nazi officials), and at the core are 25 transcripts drafted by the monitors. The most dramatic are those of August 6 and 7, 1945, into which Bernstein (a qualified scientist) inserts his commentary on the accuracy of the Germans' remarks, as well as his indignation at the rationalization by some of them that they purposely failed in order to prevent a Hitler victory. Bernstein's obiter dicta make clear his disbelief in ethical compunctions, but readers can at last reach their own conclusion. Heavily technical in patches, yet this one-of-a-kind document earns large libraries' consideration with its human-interest aspects. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>Free to Learn: Why Unleashing the Instinct to Play Will Make Our Children Happier, More Self-Reliant, and Better Students for Life</h2><p>Title: Free to Learn( Why Unleashing the Instinct to Play Will Make Our Children Happier More Self-Reliant and Better Students for Life) Binding: Hardcover Author: GrayPeter Publisher: BasicBooks(AZ)</p><p><b>Peter Gray</b> is a research professor in the Department of Psychology at Boston College.

Peter Gray's <i>Free to Learn</i> leads us out of the maze of unforeseen consequences to a more natural way of letting children educate themselves. Gray's message might seem too good to be true, but it rests upon a strong scientific foundation. <i>Free to Learn</i> can have an immediate impact on the children in your life.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Roberta Michnick Golinkoff, author of <i>Einstein Never Used Flash Cards</i> and <i>A Mandate for Playful Learning in Preschool</i></b><br> A compelling and most enjoyable read. Gray illustrates how removing play from childhood, in combination with increasing the pressures of modern-day schooling, paradoxically reduces the very skills we want our children to learn. The decline of play is serious business.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Laurette Lynn, Unplugged Mom.com</b><br> [A] well written, well organized and beautifully stated piece of work .I emphatically recommend this book for any parent as well as any educator or anyone interested in improving education for our society.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Mothering.com</b><br> [<i>Free to Learn</i> is] a powerful agent of transformation.

Initially published as a much-abridged serial, the text first appeared in its full and present form in 1895.In 1895 Hardy's final novel, the great tale of <i>Jude The Obscure</i>, sent shockwaves of indignation rolling across Victorian England. Hardy had dared to write frankly about sexuality and to indict the institutions of marriage, education, and religion. But he had, in fact, created a deeply moral work. The stonemason Jude Fawley is a dreamer; his is a tragedy of unfulfilled aims. With his tantalizing cousin Sue Bridehead, the last and most extraordinary of Hardy's heroines, Jude takes on the world--and discovers, tragically, its brutal indifference. The most powerful expression of Hardy's philosophy, and a profound exploration of man's essential loneliness, <i>Jude The Obscure</i> is a great and beautiful book. "His style touches sublimity."--T.S. Eliot</p><h2>Sense and Nonsense About Crime, Drugs, and Communities</h2><p>Samuel Walker&#39;s SENSE AND NONSENSE ABOUT CRIME, DRUGS, AND COMMUNITIES was one of the first books to challenge common misconceptions about crime, and the new Eighth Edition remains uniquely effective at doing so. Described as a &#34;masterful critique&#34; of American policies on everything from crime control, to guns, to drugs, this incisive book cuts through popular myths and political rhetoric while emphasizing current research and proven practice. The result is a lucid, research-based work that clearly reveals what does not work in crime policy while identifying shared characteristics of successful approaches, including carefully defined, narrowly focused, problem-oriented programs in policing and prosecution. This engaging text captures the full complexity of the administration of justice while providing readers with a clear sense of its key principles and general patterns.</p><p>Samuel Walker is Professor Emeritus of Criminal Justice at the University of Nebraska, Omaha, where he taught for 31 years before retiring in 2005. He is the author of 13 books on policing, criminal justice history and policy, and civil liberties.

L. Mencken</i> <br><br>Widely recognized as <b>Willa Cather</b>&#x2019;s greatest novel, <i>My �ntonia</i> is a soulful and rich portrait of a pioneer woman&#x2019;s simple yet heroic life. The spirited daughter of Bohemian immigrants, �ntonia must adapt to a hard existence on the desolate prairies of the Midwest. Enduring childhood poverty, teenage seduction, and family tragedy, she eventually becomes a wife and mother on a Nebraska farm. A fictional record of how women helped forge the communities that formed a nation, <i>My �ntonia</i> is also a hauntingly eloquent celebration of the strength, courage, and spirit of America&#x2019;s early pioneers.<br><br><b>Gordon Tapper</b> is Assistant Professor of English at DePauw University. He is the author of <i>The Machine That Sings: Modernism, Hart Crane, and the Culture of the Body</i>, from Routledge.</p><p>It seems almost sacrilege to infringe upon a book as soulful and rich as Willa Cather's <i>My �ntonia</i> by offering comment. First published in 1918, and set in Nebraska in the late 19th century, this tale of the spirited daughter of a Bohemian immigrant family planning to farm on the untamed land ("not a country at all but the material out of which countries are made") comes to us through the romantic eyes of Jim Burden. He is, at the time of their meeting, newly orphaned and arriving at his grandparents' neighboring farm on the same night her family strikes out to make good in their new country. Jim chooses the opening words of his recollections deliberately: "I first heard of �ntonia on what seemed to be an interminable journey across the great midland plain of North America," and it seems almost certain that readers of Cather's masterpiece will just as easily pinpoint the first time they heard of �ntonia and her world. It seems equally certain that they, too, will remember that moment as one of great light in an otherwise unremarkable trip through the world.<p> �ntonia, who, even as a grown woman somewhat downtrodden by circumstance and hard work, "had not lost the fire of life," lies at the center of almost every human condition that Cather's novel effortlessly untangles. She represents immigrant struggles with a foreign land and tongue, the restraints on women of the time (with which Cather was very much concerned), the more general desires for love, family, and companionship, and the great capacity for forbearance that marked the earliest settlers on the frontier.</p><p> As if all this humanity weren't enough, Cather paints her descriptions of the vastness of nature--the high, red grass, the road that "ran about like a wild thing," the endless wind on the plains--with strokes so vivid as to make us feel in our bones that we've just come in from a walk on that very terrain ourselves. As the story progresses, Jim goes off to the University in Lincoln to study Latin (later moving on to Harvard and eventually staying put on the East Coast in another neat encompassing of a stage in America's development) and learns Virgil's phrase "<i>Optima dies ... prima fugit</i>" that Cather uses as the novel's epigraph. "The best days are the first to flee"--this could be said equally of childhood and the earliest hours of this country in which the open land, much like <i>My �ntonia</i>, was nothing short of a rhapsody in prairie sky blue. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

Truman is remembered today as an icon--the plain-speaking president, "Give 'em Hell Harry," the chief executive who put "The Buck Stops Here" on his desk. But Alonzo L. Hamby shows that there was more to Truman than the pugnacious fighter so prominent in popular memory. Insecure, ambitious, a man of honor, a partisan loyalist, an agrarian Jeffersonian Democrat who became a champion of big government, Truman was a complex figure who fought long and hard to triumph over his own weaknesses.<br> In <em>Man of the People</em>, Hamby offers a gripping account of this distinctively American life, tracing Truman's remarkable rise from marginal farmer in rural Missouri to shaper of the postwar world. Truman comes alive in these pages as he has nowhere else, making his way from the farmhouse, to the front lines in France during World War I, to the difficult small-business world of Kansas City--all the time struggling with his deep feelings of inadequacy and immense ambition. Hamby provides an honest, incisive look at the rising politician's relationship with Kansas City political boss Tom Pendergast, who sponsored his career from the county court to the U.S. Senate. We see how Truman, a ferocious and skilled fighter in factional party battles, tried to balance his sense of honor with his political loyalties. Free of corruption himself, he nevertheless refused to repudiate Pendergast even when the boss was sinking under the weight of his ties to organized crime. Hamby also offers the best account yet of Truman's critical years in the Senate, covering not only his World War II probe of the defense program but also his neglected and revealing populist investigations of the railroads during the 1930s. He demonstrates that Truman was one of the most popular and respected members of the upper house.<br> Hamby is particularly acute in his portrait of Truman's volatile presidency. He criticizes some aspects of the decision to drop the atomic bombs against Japan but concludes that, considered in context, the act was understandable and justified. Providing new insight into the Cold War, he identifies the Turkish and Iranian crisis of 1946 as crucial turning points in Truman's attitudes toward the Soviet Union. Thoroughly covering Truman's struggle for "liberalism in a conservative age," Hamby also sheds great light on the president's Fair Deal domestic program.<br> Harry Truman, Hamby writes, was a flawed man--insecure, often petty and vindictive--yet one of the great presidents of the twentieth century. But Americans cherish him less for <em>what</em> he did than for <em>who</em> he was: an ordinary person who worked his way up the political ladder to the summit of power. In <em>Man of the People</em>, Alonzo L. Hamby provides a richly perceptive biography, giving us the best look yet at who Truman was, how he changed, and why he triumphed.<br></p><p><br><strong>Alonzo L. Hamby</strong> is Professor of History at Ohio University. His books include <em>Liberalism and its Challengers</em>, <em>The Imperial Years</em>, and <em>Beyond the New Deal: Harry S. Truman and American Liberalism</em>.<br>"A cool, highly nuanced examination of Truman's cultural and political milieus....Includes excellent analyses of Truman's difficulties in keeping together the loose New Deal coalition and his vacillation before recognizing Israel."--Kirkus Reviews<br><br>"One of the most eminent Truman scholars in the historical profession, at the capstone of his career, has brought us a deeply researched, often surprising scholarly life of the thirty-third President, raising questions that will absorb the general reader and animate historians for years to<br>come."--Michael R. Beschloss, author of The Crisis Years: Kennedy and Khrushchev, 1960-1963<br><br>"This rich and illuminating book is by far the most persuasive of the many Truman biographies. Unlike previous writers, Hamby neither demonizes nor idealizes his subject, but instead presents him as a complex, fallible human being whose strengths are in many ways the reciprocals of his<br>weaknesses."--Fred I. Greenstein, Princeton University, author of The Hidden-Hand Presidency: Eisenhower as Leader<br><br>"Alonzo Hamby has brought his considerable experience as a Truman scholar to this major study. His rich and insightful account of a man who has become mythical not for what he did but for 'who America believed him to be' should do much to dispel mysteries about the man and his time. This<br>biography is thorough, both for Truman's public as well as his private life. Hamby does not hesitate to offer some tough analyses, from the Truman role in ending World War II and the bombing of Hiroshima to Korea and General MacArthur."--Herbert S. Parmet, Professor Emeritus, The City University of<br>New York, author of J.F.K.: The Presidency of John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon and His America<br><br>"In his preface Alonzo Hamby, the leading Truman scholar, hopes readers will find this book a 'crackling good story.' Few books on the presidency crackle half as much. None other so profoundly deepens our understanding of Harry Truman and his times. Hamby's probing not only explains Truman<br>with a new clarity but shows why Truman, discredited when he left office, is today regarded as one of our great presidents. This book will be read for a long time."--Robert J. Donovan, noted Washington journalist, author of Conflict and Crisis: The Presidency of Harry S. Truman, 1945-1948 and<br>Tumultuous Years: The Presidency of Harry S. Truman, 1949-1953<br><br>"Hamby's rich portrait reveals a man devoted to honesty and efficiency in public service, who excelled at building bipartisan coalitions, displayed an ability to make hard decisions, and was 'magnificently right' in his contributions to the early civil rights movement and to the mobilization<br>of the West against the Soviet challenge....[Hamby's] biography vividly defines the man, both public and private."--Publishers Weekly<br><br>"Is there need for another comprehensive Truman biography? Yes, and noted Truman historian Hamby provides it."--Library Journal<br><br>"Man of the People reveals the mastery of factual detail and contemporary scholarship we have come to expect from Alonzo Hamby. What is an additional bonus is the fascinating and thoroughly convincing portrait of Truman the man contained in these pages. This is the definitive biography of one<br>of the great presidents of the 20th century."--John A. Garraty, Governor Morris Professor, Columbia University<br><br>"Man of the People is an altogether splendid biography. It combines well-paced narrative and sensitive portraiture with incisive analysis in setting Harry Truman against the troubles and triumphs of a turbulent time."--Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.<br><br>"A superb new biography.... The Truman we meet in these pages is more troubled, complicated, and genuine than the man we have read about before. While Mr. Hamby's account lacks the narrative drive of David McCullough's Pulitzer Prize-winning Truman...it is superior...in providing a clear<br>interpretative framework for understanding the relationship between Truman's personal traits and his momentous Presidential decisions.... What Mr. Hamby has done, with great skill, is to remind us of the real Harry Truman, to demythologize him without slighting his accomplishments or his rough road<br>to success."--The New York Times Book Review</p><h2>Cases and Materials on the Law of Torts, 5th (American Casebook Series)</h2><p>This fifth edition, continuing the use of minimally edited cases, serves as a vehicle for teaching first-year students the essential techniques of case analysis and legal method. The book is modified to include developments in tort law since the fourth edition was published in 2004.

What exactly is food addiction? How is it different than an eating disorder such as bulimia or binge eating?&nbsp; Is it possible to draw a hard line between indulging cravings for "comfort food" and engaging in substance abuse? For people struggling with food addictions, recognizing their condition remains a frustrating battle. Diagnosis and treatment evades the suffering food addict.&nbsp;<br><br> This revised second edition contains the latest research&nbsp; on food addiction as well as practical recovery strategies for people facing the complicated challenges of comfort overeating, eating disorders and food addictions. This book offers an affirming and manageable path to healthy and sustainable eating habits.&nbsp;<br>You will learn:&nbsp;<ul><li>How to identify the trigger foods that you are powerless to resist so you're never caught off guard.</li><li>Tricks on how to stop eating sugar or use food as a crutch, two of the hardest habits to break.&nbsp;</li><li>Stop binge-eating or grazing all day and avoid piling on weight.</li><li>End the night eating so you fall asleep faster, sleep better and feel great the next day.</li><li>How to stop feeling ashamed when you step on the scale and are tempted to drown your sorrows in the kitchen</li></ul>This book is for anyone who has experienced yo-yo dieting, food obsessions and food cravings and for people suffering with an eating disorder. It is for anyone who wants to stop eating because of stress or boredom. If you feel guilty about your eating or ashamed of your body, and if you want to lose weight and keep it off and still love your food, this book is for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions about food addiction, sugar addiction or binge eating disorders:1) Is food really addictive?&nbsp;Food, especially sugar and flour, are extremely addictive. Especially if you have a history of obesity and drug addiction in your family. Food addiction can be disguised as obesity, diabetes, hypertension and can affect your health the same as alcohol and cocaine.&nbsp;2) What foods are addictive?Sugar and flour are addictive, especially when in chocolate, bagels, soda, muffins, cereal, popcorn and pizza. These are the most addictive foods.&nbsp;3) What does a healthy diet or food plan look like? Eat "real" foods, that are NOT processed. Vegetables, fruits, proteins (salmon, chicken) and fat (nuts, seeds, olive oil). Some people find diary and grains also too triggering and may have to eliminate these. Quit sugar and flour!4) How hard is it to quit sugar? Sugar detox is challenging but doable. It takes three weeks or less of&nbsp; "cold turkey" detox from sugar. If you slowly stop sugar by quitting soda and candy, it may take longer - weeks until you quit completely.&nbsp;&nbsp;5) Do you have to stop eating sugar forever? Some people who are truly food addicted find that they have to stop eating sugar completely, even sweeteners. Try to cut down and eat moderately, but if you find that you obsess and eat foods compulsively, you may have to stop eating sugar, one day at a time.&nbsp;6) Why do I lose weight, only to gain it more back later?&nbsp;Obesity, like addiction, is a chronic progressive condition that is partly genetic. This means that it gets harder to control both over time. A normal approach does not work for an abnormal genetics or body chemistry / brain neurochemistry.&nbsp;7) Is it important to treat food addiction? Can I just eat sugar, even if I wont' lose weight?Any addiction is chronic and progressive.&nbsp; The compulsion to eat and overeat gets stronger over time. You may find that you eat more&nbsp; and more junk food and more often. You may find that you have food obsessions and may choose junk foods over healthy foods. You may get sick with diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, obesity.&nbsp;</p><p>This book is the culmination of a life of experience. In my twenties, I suffered from the eating disorder of bulimia. After years of managing this and sporting a weight gain of over 100 pounds, I finally stumbled upon the solution. My professional perspective as a physician treating thousands of people struggling with alcohol and drugs, showed me that how I ate was not different than those of my patients. The pattern of compulsivity, secrecy, shame and feeling trapped was identical. I connected the dots: treat the eating disorder like an addiction and recovery would surely follow. I lost&nbsp; the excess100 pounds twelve years ago. More important, I am happy to say that the obsession around food and eating quieted.&nbsp;Now I speak internationally on this&nbsp; recovery. I am aware of how many people suffer the same struggle that I did. They are afraid to acknowledge their battle with food as addiction: why take on more stigma and worse - treatment which means having to stop your favourite food?&nbsp;I have encountered resistance from the medical and bariatric community, medical dieticians to the general public - even from those who privately suffer with the same issues. This has made me determined to make this a platform to help individuals, who are dying of their eating disorders and their obesity related conditions, and foremost, political stand. I join the ranks of Dr Robert Lustig and Dr Nicole Avena, both physician advocates who call the food industry to task.&nbsp;&nbsp;The food industry is like the drug dealer who makes profit from the vulnerabilities of our primitive brain reward circuitry wired to desire sweet energy laded foods. Food that have been deliberately engineered to make unnaturally processed foods irresistible. Sugar is the crack of food.Food Junkies is my identification and solution to this problem. I am delighted to see more people talking about this, so that the shame of addiction slowly dissipates and people are&nbsp; recovering their physical and mental health worldwide. This is sweetness beyond belief.&nbsp;The power is ours!Vera Tarman, MD, MSc, FCFP, ABAM, is a specialist in food addiction medicine. She is the medical director of Renascent, one of Canada's largest treatment centres for substance abuse.&nbsp;She has spearheaded an patient and outpatient program&nbsp;for food addiction.

Balint traces the origins of the basic fault to the early formative period, during which serious discrepancies arise between the needs of the individual and the care and nurture available. These Discrepancies create a kind of deficiency state.<br><br>On the basis of this concept, Balint assumes the existence of a specific area of the mind in shich all the processes have an exclusively two-person structure consisting of the individual and the individual's primary object. Its dynamic force, originating from the basic fault has the overwhelming aim of 'putting things right'. This area is contrasted with two others: the area of the Oedipus complex, which has essentially a triangular structure comprising the individual and two of his objects, and whose characteristic dynamism has the form of a conflict; and the area of creation, in which there are no objects in the proper sense, and whose characteristic force is the urge to create, to produce</p><p>When it was first published in 1968, Michael Balint&#39;s The Basic Fault laid the groundwork for a far-ranging reformation in psychoanalytic theory. This reformation is still incomplete, for it remains true today that despite the proliferation of techniques and schools, we do not know which are more correct or more successful--and all psychoanalysts continue to encounter intractable cases of mental disorder. Balint cogently argues that ordinary, &#39;rigid&#39; techniques and theories are doomed to failure in such cases because of their emphasis on interpretation.&nbsp;Michael Balint<b>,</b> M.D., Ph.D., M.Sc., who died in 1971, was a psychoanalyst of international reputation, whose originality expressed itself both in clinical practice and in teaching. His involvement with the development of psychoanalytic theory and practice was paralleled by a concern with stimulating understanding of psychodynamic principles among other professional groups, particularly general practitioners. His varied and prolific writings attest to these aims.</p><h2>Principles of International Law (Concise Hornbook Series)</h2><p>Murphy&#x2019;s Principles of International Law is designed to be either a stand-alone text or a complement to all the major casebooks on the topic.

Might there he a code of ethics in the animal kingdom? Must an animal be human to he humane? In this provocative book, a renowned scientist takes on those who have declared ethics uniquely human Making a compelling case for a morality grounded in biology, he shows how ethical behavior is as much a matter of evolution as any other trait, in humans and animals alike.</p><p>World famous for his brilliant descriptions of Machiavellian power plays among chimpanzees-the nastier side of animal life--Frans de Waal here contends that animals have a nice side as well. Making his case through vivid anecdotes drawn from his work with apes and monkeys and holstered by the intriguing, voluminous data from his and others' ongoing research, de Waal shows us that many of the building blocks of morality are natural: they can he observed in other animals. Through his eyes, we see how not just primates but all kinds of animals, from marine mammals to dogs, respond to social rules, help each other, share food, resolve conflict to mutual satisfaction, even develop a crude sense of justice and fairness.</p><p>Natural selection may be harsh, but it has produced highly successful species that survive through cooperation and mutual assistance. De Waal identifies this paradox as the key to an evolutionary account of morality, and demonstrates that human morality could never have developed without the foundation of fellow feeling our species shares with other animals. As his work makes clear, a morality grounded in biology leads to an entirely different conception of what it means to he human--and humane.</p></p><p>In <i>Good Natured</i> Frans de Waal, ethologist and primatologist, asks us to reconsider human morality in light of moral aspects that can be identified in animals. Within the complex negotiations of human society, a moral action may involve thoughts and feelings of guilt, reciprocity, obligation, expectations, rules, or community concern. De Waal finds these aspects of morality prevalent in other animal societies, mostly primate, and suggests that the two philosophical camps supporting nature and nurture may have to be disbanded in order to adequately understand human morality. A theoretician, de Waal is meticulous in his research, cautious not to extrapolate too much from his findings, and logically sound in his arguments. He also writes with precision and a flair for the dramatic, carrying readers along with graceful ease and vivid examples.Frans B. M. de Waal is C. H.

The medical world knows him as Fred Epstein, M.D., the neurosurgeon who pioneered life-saving procedures for previously inoperable tumors in children. His patients and their families know him simply as Dr. Fred, the "miracle man" who has extended them both a healing hand and an open heart. <br><br>"I simply can't accept the idea of kids dying," is how Epstein explains his commitment to saving patients. As a child, he had to overcome severe learning disabilities to realize his dream of becoming a doctor. Later, as the world's leading pediatric neurosurgeon, he did whatever it took to rescue children that other doctors had given up on. <br><br>Epstein credits his young patients as his most important teachers. "We tend to think of children as fragile, little people," he writes. "To me, they're giants." <i>If I Get to Five</i> relates the unforgettable experiences he's shared with children-lessons in courage, compassion, love, and hope-that we can all draw on to overcome adversity at any stage of life. In <i>If I Get to Five</i>, Epstein meditates on these lessons at a time when they parallel his own experiences, as he recovers from a near-fatal head injury.<br><br><i>If I Get to Five</i> is a riveting profile of courage and compassion.

The balance of his life was taken up with his unremitting devotion to work, and a search for a cure to his illness that took him all over the world. His travel essays were publihsed widely, and his short fiction was gathered in many volumes. His first full-length work of fiction, <b>Treasure Island</b>, was published in 1883 and brought him great fame, which only increased with the publication of <b>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</b> (1886). He followed with the Scottish romances <b>Kidnapped</b> (1886) and <b>The Master of Ballantrae</b> (1889). In 1888 he set out with his family for the South Seas, traveling to the leper colony at Molokai, and finally settling in Samoa, where he died.<p><b>From Jenny Davidson&#x2019;s Introduction to <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Other Stories</i></b></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert Louis Stevenson&#x2019;s novella <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> is at once a sharply conceived allegory about the psychological costs of living the respectable life and a thrilling page-turner as compelling as anything written by such modern masters of horror as Clive Barker and Stephen King. Published in January 1886, Stevenson&#x2019;s story quickly became a best-seller on both sides of the Atlantic.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The American actor-manager Richard Mansfield purchased the copyright to Stevenson&#x2019;s novella with the goal of maintaining exclusive rights for theatrical adaptation, but the copyright laws failed to prevent a host of other impresarios from mounting competing productions; one producer touring in New England advertised that <i>his</i> Mr. Hyde was so terrifying that he had to be kept chained in a boxcar on the way to the theater. Though the text of the adaptation, by playwright Thomas Russell Sullivan, would seem dated and melodramatic to modern readers as does the trick photograph in which Mansfield&#x2019;s Hyde crouches behind his Jekyll, ready to spring the actor&#x2019;s performance brought to life for his contemporaries all the most terrifying aspects of Stevenson&#x2019;s story. First acted at the Boston Museum on May 9, 1887, as Mansfield&#x2019;s biographer Paul Wilstach recounts, <i>Jekyll and Hyde</i> had immensely powerful effects on its audience: Strong men shuddered and women fainted and were carried out of the theatre. . . . People went away from Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&#x2019; afraid to enter their houses alone. They feared to sleep in darkened rooms. They were awakened by nightmare. Yet it had the fascination of crime and mystery, and they came again and again&#x201d; (<i>Richard</i> <i>Mansfield, the Man and the Actor</i>, pp. 146 147; see For Further Reading&#x201d;).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spectators found it difficult to believe that Mansfield transformed himself without chemical assistance, and he was charged with using acids, phosphorus, or even an inflatable rubber suit to facilitate the transformation from Jekyll to Hyde. The truth of the matter, Wilstach goes on to say, was that his only change was in the muscles of his face, the tones of his yielding voice, and the posture of his body&#x201d; (pp. 147 148). The account of Mansfield&#x2019;s friend and fellow actor De Wolf Hopper confirms the effectiveness of the performance. As the two men sat one evening in a darkened room at the Continental Hotel in Philadelphia, Hopper asked Mansfield what he did and how he did it: And then and there, only four feet away, under the green light, as that booming clock struck the hour he did it changed to Hyde before my very eyes and I remember that I, startled to pieces, jumped up and cried that I&#x2019;d ring the bell if he didn&#x2019;t stop!&#x2019;&#x201d; (Wilstach, p. 155).</p><p>The great Victorian actor Henry Irving soon invited Mansfield to bring his production to the Lyceum Theatre in London, and <i>Jekyll and Hyde</i> opened there on August 4, 1888. On the last day of August, however, an event took place that would transform the significance of Mansfield&#x2019;s production and, indeed, of Stevenson&#x2019;s story as well. The mutilated corpse of a prostitute was discovered in the East End of London, the first in a series of five or more murders attributed to the terrifying figure who would come to be known as Jack the Ripper. The Ripper cut his victims&#x2019; throats, sliced open their torsos, and removed their organs; he was suspected of having trained as either a butcher or a medical man.</p><p>As subsequent bodies were discovered, London went wild with fear. Reporters drew public attention to the extraordinary poverty and squalor of Whitechapel in the East End, where most of the murders took place, and pointed to the hypocrisy of a society that allowed such neighborhoods to exist in the face of the nation&#x2019;s great prosperity, thereby encouraging the emergence of a monster like the Ripper. Amid riots and public frenzies, many citizens wrote letters to the newspapers and the police suggesting precautions that might be taken to prevent more murders. These suggestions ranged from providing better street lighting and giving policemen whistles as a rapid warning system, to arming prostitutes with revolvers, or even dressing up police officers as prostitutes and protecting their throats and torsos with metal corsets, perhaps attached to batteries that would electrocute the unwary attacker. Many of these letters singled out prominent members of society as suspects in the Ripper murders. At the peak of the frenzy the police received more than a thousand letters a week, and the actor Richard Mansfield was among those charged with being responsible for the Whitechapel murders. As Donald Rumbelow relates in his history of the crimes, The writer accusing Mansfield had not been able to rest for a day and a night after seeing the performance, claiming that no man could disguise himself so well and that, since Mansfield worked himself up to such a frenzy on stage, he probably did the real life murders too&#x201d; (<i>The Complete Jack the Ripper</i>, p. 124).</p></p><h2>Introduction to the Theory of Statistics</h2><p>100% Satisfaction is Guaranteed!

While longtime fans of Garwood hope she won't forsake the historical romance genre that has been so successful for her, this versatile author is coming into her own as a creator of amazingly complex and detailed suspense novels. In <i>Mercy</i>, Theo Buchanan, the brother of FBI agent Nick Buchanan from <i>Heartbreaker</i>, Garwood's first foray into suspense fiction, meets surgeon Dr. Michelle "Mike" Renard when he throws up on her designer dress at a New Orleans gala. Dr. Mike saves Theo's life with an emergency appendectomy, enabling him to return to Boston and his job as a federal prosecutor.<p> But Theo can't stop thinking about Mike and her little hometown on the bayou. After concluding an investigation and trial that brings down a powerful organized crime syndicate, Theo receives several death threats and his boss recommends he keep a low profile. What better place to go incognito than Bowen, Louisiana, where the catfish practically throw themselves at your fishing pole and where a certain pretty young doctor is opening her new practice? But when Theo arrives, he finds life in Bowen isn't quite as idyllic as he thought. Someone has ransacked Mike's new office and seems dead set on harming her. As Theo struggles to protect Mike, he uncovers a ring of upper-crust criminals willing to do anything, even murder, to keep their dirty little secret--all $40 million of it--from being discovered. What connection could they possibly have to Mike? And why does everyone under the age of 18 keep calling Theo "Coach"?

Born of Russian Jewish parents in Lachine, Quebec in 1915, he was raised in Chicago. He received his Bachelor's degree from Northwestern University in 1937, with honors in sociology and anthropology, and did graduate work at the University of Wisconsin. During the Second World War he served in the Merchant Marines.<br><br>His first two novels,&nbsp;<b>Dangling Man</b>&nbsp;(1944) and&nbsp;<b>The Victim</b>&nbsp;(1947) are penetrating, Kafka-like psychological studies. In 1948 he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship and spent two years in Paris and traveling in Europe, where he began his picaresque novel&nbsp;<b>The Adventures of Augie March</b>, which went on to win the National Book Award for fiction in 1954. His later books of fiction include&nbsp;<b>Seize the Day</b>&nbsp;(1956);&nbsp;<b>Henderson the Rain King</b>&nbsp;(1959);&nbsp;<b>Mosby's Memoirs and Other Stories</b>&nbsp;(1968);&nbsp;<b>Mr. Sammler's Planet</b>&nbsp;(1970);&nbsp;<b>Humboldt's Gift</b>&nbsp;(1975), which won the Pulitzer Prize;&nbsp;<b>The Dean's December</b>&nbsp;(1982);&nbsp;<b>More Die of Heartbreak</b>&nbsp;(1987);&nbsp;<b>Theft</b>&nbsp;(1988);&nbsp;<b>The Bellarosa Connection</b>&nbsp;(1989);<b>The Actual</b>&nbsp;(1996);&nbsp;<b>Ravelstein</b>&nbsp;(2000); and, most recently,&nbsp;<b>Collected Stories</b>(2001).

It was only later, after admitting this dream, that I noticed the happy coincidence that all these countries begin with the letter I. A fairly auspicious sign, it seemed, on a voyage of self-discovery.<br><br> -Elizabeth Gilbert<br><br> Eat Pray Love, the blockbuster memoir from Elizabeth Gilbert, reports on the year she spent traveling in her midthirties as a means of "spiritual and personal exploration" following her divorce and a heartbreaking rebound relationship. The voyage is a success: By the end, she finds herself thinking "about the woman I have become lately, about the life that I am now living, and about how much I always wanted to be this person and live this life, liberated from the farce of pretending to be anyone other than myself." Not incidentally, she falls deeply in love with a Brazilian-Australian man in Indonesia, eventually achieving marital harmony with him (at least for a while).<br><br> In Wild, Cheryl Strayed offers a higher-stakes, working-class variation of the themes Gilbert explores in Eat Pray Love. Strayed's memoir, subtitled From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail, is another voyage of self-discovery that begins with the failure of one marriage and concludes with the promise of another (one that, as of this writing, has stuck).<br><br> In their searing narratives of self-discovery, personal growth, and redemptive love, Eat Pray Love and Wild are archetypes of a distinct literary form. These stories tap into our cultural zeitgeist-the contemporary American hunger for a life that is true to the self rather than beholden to rules and restrictions. Gilbert and Strayed are, at the beginning of the memoirs, married to loving, decent men, and they know it. But they also crave a sort of personal growth that the marriage isn't providing, and settling for love and decency doesn't feel like an option for them. After their divorces and their voyages, they have found themselves, setting the stage for second marriages, ones that afford the authentic expression of their newly discovered selves.<br><br> As mainstream as such narratives are today, they certainly aren't standard literary fare. The Western canon is waterlogged with the tears of women enduring failures in love and marriage-Emma Bovary's suicide by arsenic, Anna Karenina's suicide by locomotive, Hester Prynne's disgrace by scarlet letter-but these women tend not to achieve salvation on voyages of self-discovery. It is hard to imagine Karenina responding to the estrangement from her son with a spiritual pilgrimage to India, or Prynne responding to her ignominy by initiating a thousand-mile trek. Such women generally lacked the resources and the freedom to embark on solitary adventures, even if they'd wanted to.<br><br> Our cultural zeitgeist is not limited to women. Men, too, are seeking an authentic life and looking for a relationship that elicits their authentic self. Neil Strauss, the infamous author of The Game, a 2005 memoir of becoming a pickup artist, provides a hypermasculinized example-his voyage revolves less around solitude than around sexual conquest. In The Truth, published a decade later, Strauss now has a serious girlfriend, whom he loves. Even so, he's unwilling to commit to her. After they break up, he searches for a (nonmonogamous) relationship arrangement that allows him to live "my authentic life." As Strauss explores various relationship structures, he reflects: "I feel like these experiences are bringing me closer to something true and honest." Eventually, and to his own amazement, the buried treasure at the end of his quest turns out to be a monogamous marriage to his girlfriend from the beginning of the book. "Life is a test and you pass if you can be true to yourself," he observes. "To get the first question correct, all you have to know is who you are."<br><br> Gilbert, Strayed, and Strauss embark from different ports and travel to different destinations. But their shared emphasis on self-discovery and authenticity, especially as these qualities relate to love and marriage, distills a dominant theme in American culture today.<br><br> Is this theme leading us to better or to worse marriages?<br><br> Yes-both. The pursuit of self-expression through marriage simultaneously makes achieving marital success harder and the value of doing so greater. Consequently, the average marriage has been getting worse over time, even as the best marriages have been getting better.<br><br> Culture and History<br><br> We all have a sense of what a "traditional marriage" looks like-a matte image, of folks like June and Ward Cleaver, that provides a benchmark against which we can contrast marriage today. The anthropologist George Peter Murdock declared in 1949 that marriage is a cultural universal: a union between a man and a woman characterized by residential cohabitation, economic cooperation, and sexual activity. And, at least until the recent surge in approval of same-sex marriage, few Americans would have quarreled with this definition.<br><br> But the reality is that marriage varies drastically across cultural and historical context. In some societies, husbands and wives live apart. In others, they don't share economic resources. Approximately 85 percent of the 1,231 cultures documented in the Ethnographic Atlas Codebook practice polygyny (multiple wives for a given husband), which also has deep roots in mainstream Western culture. The Old Testament-the Jewish Torah-which provides foundational religious beliefs for most Americans today, depicts polygyny as a normative marital arrangement, one practiced by respected leaders like Abraham, Moses, and King David.<br><br> Perhaps the most significant change in marriage over time has been its conquest by love. "Until the late eighteenth century," observes the historian Stephanie Coontz, "most societies around the world saw marriage as far too vital an economic and political institution to be left entirely to the free choice of the two individuals involved, especially if they were going to base their decision on something as unreasoning and transitory as love." People valued love and preferred to love their spouse, of course, but this emotion was not an important reason to marry, nor was its cultivation or maintenance a primary function of marriage.<br><br> Consider the courtly love of medieval Europe, which was almost exclusively adulterous. Its idealization and passion were believed to be incompatible with the marital relationship, which was determined by the sorts of political and pragmatic considerations that formed the foundation of marriage for thousands of years. Such considerations included the prospect of bringing more workers into the household and forging alliances between extended family units. In the preindustrial world, the individual household was the unit of economic production-the place where spouses produced the basic necessities of life, including food, clothing, and health care. The primary functions of the marital relationship revolved around this sort of production.<br><br> In short, the institution of marriage did not come prepackaged with a set of universal principles or instructions. Rather, it has existed in countless variations across space and time. That said, all societies construe marriage as a means to the fulfillment of certain goals, and despite some variation from person to person, each society develops a loose consensus about which goals are most important to meet through marriage (economic production or emotional fulfillment, for example).<br><br> America's Two Great Marital Transitions<br><br> America has witnessed three major eras of marriage: pragmatic, love-based, and self-expressive. The first, which extended from the colonial period until around 1850, had a pragmatic emphasis in which marriage was primarily oriented toward helping spouses meet their basic economic and survival needs. The industrialized economy began to emerge during this era, but, for most Americans, the small farm remained the primary economic unit. Wives, husbands, and their children-and, frequently, extended family members-worked in and around the farmhouse to produce enough food to keep everybody fed and to create sufficient shelter and clothing to keep everybody warm.<br><br> In the pragmatic era, having a marriage that functioned effectively could be, during summer droughts or winter freezes, a matter of life and death. In an era when wage labor was scarce, governmental welfare programs meager, and civic institutions like police forces weak or nonexistent, people looked to marriage, and the broader familial alliances linked to it, to help them achieve physical and psychological security.<br><br> The Sentimentality Transition<br><br> During the latter half of the 1800s, industrialization brought massive increases in efficiency and productivity, greatly reducing the prices of consumer goods. Improvements in transportation infrastructure, including steamships and railroads, bolstered the quality and quantity of trade and mitigated the devastation of local crop failures. In 1876, the Transcontinental Express arrived in San Francisco three and a half days after leaving New York, a voyage that, ten years earlier, would have taken months. Such developments dovetailed with improvements in industrial production, including the assembly line and the mass production of steel, to make available a broad range of new products, among them household objects like sewing machines and typewriters.<br><br> Meanwhile, agricultural advances, including the invention of high-quality fertilizers and heavy machinery, made food more plentiful and less expensive. Health-related advances, including pasteurization and sanitation enhancements, substantially reduced early mortality rates. In general, the astounding pace of economic development during the second Industrial Revolution eased the everyday struggle to meet basic survival needs, which reduced people's dependence on marriage to achieve basic subsistence.<br><br> A sudden surfeit of jobs in industrial cities attracted people from rural areas and other countries. For the first time in history, young people were both geographically and economically independent of their parents. This new freedom ushered in a second era, one in which people sought to achieve personal fulfillment through marriage. During this second era, from around 1850 until around 1965, marriages had a love-based emphasis that placed a premium on helping spouses meet their love and intimacy needs.<br><br> Husbands increasingly worked as wage laborers. Wives increasingly worked as homemakers and as providers of a secondary source of income, taking on boarders or doing piecework like assembling hats and shoes. These changes yielded a new social structure in which men spent much of their time in the predominantly male world of paid employment and women spent much of their time in the predominantly female world of domestic family life. In conjunction with the elevated standard of living afforded by industrialization, the development of these sex-segregated spheres reinforced the emerging emphasis on sentimental reasons for marriage. As it became easier to meet their most basic economic and safety needs as a single person, Americans increasingly looked to marriage for love and romantic passion. For many, love became a precondition for marriage, a requirement that remains strong today.<br><br> The Authenticity Transition<br><br> The breadwinner-homemaker ideal from the love-based era had been teetering for decades, especially as more and more women entered the workforce, but it had a major last gasp in the 1950s and early 1960s. Because television shows, including Leave It to Beaver and The Adventures of Ozzie &amp; Harriet, first rose to prominence during this era, the 1950s marriage has been enshrined in popular consciousness as the "traditional marriage," even though it was, by historical standards, bizarre.<br><br> In the 1960s, a series of cultural events set the stage for the countercultural revolution during the second half of the decade. The birth control pill became widely available in 1961, helping to launch the sexual revolution. The journalist Betty Friedan published The Feminine Mystique in 1963, triggering the second-wave feminist movement. Leveraging the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.'s influence, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Great Society legislation into law in 1964 and 1965, further bolstering the emphasis on individual rights. The erstwhile Harvard psychology professor Timothy Leary released the spoken-word album Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out in 1967, exhorting Americans to discover themselves and explore "the meaning of inner life."<br><br> Meanwhile, in a growing number of marriages, both spouses were gainfully employed outside the home, and, for broad swaths of the populace, the standard of living was rising rapidly. Over time, the American economy became increasingly postindustrialized, with jobs in the services, information, and research sectors supplanting those in manufacturing. Seeking to develop the intellectual skills that are especially prized in postindustrial economies, more Americans went to college. Entrepreneurship and the generation of novel ideas fueled economic growth.<br><br> The trend toward increasingly cerebral lives, especially among the college educated, dovetailed with the countercultural revolution to launch Americans-including Elizabeth Gilbert, Cheryl Strayed, and Neil Strauss-on voyages of self-discovery and personal growth. Consequently, the nature of social connection changed. During the third era, from around 1965 to today, marriage has a self-expressive emphasis that places a premium on spouses helping each other meet their authenticity and personal-growth needs. According to the sociologist Robert Bellah, a self-expressive relationship "is created by full sharing of authentic feelings," and love "becomes the mutual exploration of infinitely rich, complex, and exciting selves."<br><br> The divorce rate-the number of divorces per year per one thousand married women-had been slowly rising for over a century (with a brief dip during the Great Depression and a brief spike following World War II). But, as illustrated in the chart on the following page, it skyrocketed between 1965 and 1980, largely due to the rise of the self-expressive marriage. As we'll see in chapter 4, however, Americans eventually adjusted to the self-expressive era; divorce rates leveled off and even fell slightly, largely because people stopped marrying so young.<br><br> Echoes of Abraham Maslow<br><br> The historical changes in American marriage-from the pragmatic to the love-based to the self-expressive eras-exhibit striking parallels to the psychologist Abraham Maslow's famous hierarchy of needs. As illustrated on the following page, this hierarchy is typically represented as a triangle that encompasses, from bottom to top, physiological needs (for air, water, food, etc.), safety needs (for physical protection, psychological safety, economic security, etc.), belonging and love needs (for friendship, intimacy, romantic love, etc.), esteem needs (for self-esteem, self-respect, esteem from others, etc.), and self-actualization needs (to discover one's unique character strengths, to live...</p><h2>Handbook of Medicinal Herbs</h2><p>Still considered the definitive work on medicinal herbs and their uses after two decades, the <b>Handbook of Medicinal Herbs</b> has undergone a long-anticipated revision.

Phenomenally researched, it has the support of leading scholars of the American frontier.WYATT EARP <p>On the afternoon of October 26, 1881, at just about three o'clock, four grim men strode down the dusty streets of Tombstone, Arizona&#x2014;Deputy Marshall Wyatt Earp, determined to help arrest the rustlers threatening the lives of his two brothers, Virgil and Morgan, and "Doc" Holliday. A fierce gun battle erupted. In less than thirty seconds, it was over. When the smoke cleared outside the O.K. Corral, three of the rustlers lay dead.</p> <p>We all know the story of Wyatt Earp and the O.K. Corral &#x2014;at least, we all think that we know it. Glamorized and mythologized by a century of history and Hollywood, the real story has grown nearly beyond recognition. One question continues to intrigue Wild West aficionados everywhere: Wyatt Earp . . . hero or villain? Now, at last, this scrupulously researched biography separates the man from the myth, and offers fascinating clues to the answer.</p> <p>Based on recently discovered material, including newspapers believed to have been lost as well as personal accounts from Earp's friends, enemies, and acquaintances, this definitive biography paints a superbly balanced portrait of the man who helped shape the modern view of the Old West. A rich panorama of nineteenth-century American culture and politics, Wyatt Earp brings a fresh perspective to the life of a common man of uncommon courage, whose ultimate wish was to live a quiet life.</p> <p>The legend of Wyatt Earp began on the Kansas plains, where he toiled as a lawman in the untamed cowtowns of Wichita and Dodge City. But the booming mine towns of the Far West promised greater riches. It was in Tombstone, a wild, lawless mining camp masquerading as a town, that Wyatt Earp and his brothers determined to make their fortune. As Tombstone grew, so did the demand that someone enforce the law, and with their reputations preceding them, the brothers took up the call and the badges.</p> <p>They found themselves up against killers and thieves who had decided that the riches of the Arizona territory were theirs for the taking. While the sparring between the lawmen and the outlaws reached its most storied point at the O.K. Corral, that bloody confrontation&#x2014;rare in the Old West&#x2014;was far from the end of the feud. When friends of the dead men took revenge on Virgil and Morgan, Wyatt Earp, with his good friend Doc Holliday and a carefully chosen group of men, carried out a ruthless vendetta. Their actions created the legacy of Wyatt Earp that would live ever after.</p> <p>From the Kansas plains to Tombstone, from Nome to San Francisco, here is the complete, unvarnished story of Wyatt Earp as it has never before been told, with a cast of characters whose names ring with the very spirit of the Old West: Ike Clanton, Curley Bill, and John Ringo among them.</p> <p>The story of Wyatt Earp's life evokes memories of a thousand Hollywood westerns, with good reason.

If you're interested in difficult childhoods, sexual misadventures, aesthetics, cultural history, and the reasons that a club sandwich and other meals&#x2015;including breakfast&#x2015;have remained in the memory of the present writer, keep reading.<br>&#x2015;from <i>Feelings Are Facts</i></p><p>In this memoir, dancer, choreographer, and filmmaker Yvonne Rainer traces her personal and artistic coming of age. <i>Feelings Are Facts </i>(the title comes from a dictum by Rainer's one-time psychotherapist) uses diary entries, letters, program notes, excerpts from film scripts, snapshots, and film-frame enlargements to present a vivid portrait of an extraordinary artist and woman in postwar America. </p><p>Rainer tells of a California childhood in which she was farmed out by her parents to foster families and orphanages, of sexual and intellectual initiations in San Francisco and Berkeley, and of artistic discoveries and accomplishments in the New York City dance world. Rainer studied with Martha Graham and Merce Cunningham in the late 1950s and early 1960s, cofounded the Judson Dance Theater in 1962, hobnobbed with New York artists including Robert Rauschenberg, Robert Morris (her lover and partner for several years), and Yoko Ono, and became involved with feminist and antiwar causes in the 1970s and 1980s. Rainer writes about how she constructed her dances&#x2015;including <i>The Mind Is a Muscle</i> and its famous section, <i>Trio A</i>, as well as the recent <i>After Many a Summer Dies the Swan</i>&#x2015;and about turning from dance to film and back to dance. And she writes about meeting her longtime partner Martha Gever and discovering the pleasures of domestic life. </p></p><p>Yvonne Rainer is a dancer, choreographer, and filmmaker.A transformative career in dance and the development of an experimental artist are examined in choreographer, dancer and filmmaker Rainer's engrossing memoir. Organized by concepts, such as her burgeoning sexuality and her cultural memories, rather than by strict chronology, the structure makes a difficult childhood seem even more unmoored and the dizzying parade of men she slept with more kaleidoscopic. Rainer doesn't have many kind words for anyone in her early years and is equally hard on herself. A ferocious intelligence combined with years of psychotherapy have made her intensely self-aware, and Rainer exposes her flaws, acknowledging potential objections to her behavior and character. Rainer's position at the epicenter of postmodernism in dance in the early '60s is illuminated through descriptions and photographs of working and playing with fellow Judson Dance Theater pioneers such as Trisha Brown and Steve Paxton, as well as artists like Robert Rauschenberg and Andy Warhol. Particularly fascinating are her descriptions of her intentions in creating certain dances and the struggle between directing dancers and allowing improvisation to color the work. The explorations of the Judson crew, including Rainer, continue to influence contemporary dance, and Rainer's chronicle of her journey as an artist is a winning addition to the literature about this groundbreaking era. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A celebration of rave's quest for the perfect beat definitive chronicle of rave culture and electronic dance music.</p><p><strong>Simon Reynolds</strong> is a Consulting Editor at <em>Spin</em> magazine. He is the author of <em>Blissed Out: The Raptures of Rock</em> (1990) and, with Joy Press, of <em>The Sex Revolts: Gender,</em> <em>Rebellion and Rock 'n' Roll</em> (1995).Rock journalist Reynolds (The Sex Revolts, not reviewed) chronicles how MDMA (a psychedelic amphetamine, a.k.a. ``ecstasy'') and MIDI (computer sound technology) together spawned the unique dance culture of the ``chemical generation.'' While America has never quite caught on to electronic dance music, techno and acid house have been the last decade's dominant European pop music genres. Reynolds, a writer for Rolling Stone, Spin, and iD, has been watching the scene since the late 1980s, when England, Germany, and Holland began transforming imported Detroit techno and Chicago house. Once ecstasy was introduced into British clubs, its sense-heightening and empathy-elevating effects fused with the soundtrack, becoming for house what LSD was for psychedelic rock. Reynolds, declaring a ``rockist'' bias, mostly prefers discussing recording artists, DJs, and subgenres over describing rave culture's underground dance clubs, illegal mass parties in warehouses and country fields, pirate radio stations, or the musics sociological significance. For the uninitiated, his taxonomy of acid house's descendents (Manchester indie-dance, bleep and bass, Belgian hardcore, breakbeat 'ardcore, ambient techno, trance, darkcore, Dutch gabba, happy, jungle, to name a few) may seem obsessive. This encyclopedic overview, however, dispassionately charts the inevitable rise and fall of drug-based musical fashion. As dopamine and serotonin abuse left the formerly blissed-out ravers with a need for faster tracksup to 300 bpmand additional drugs such as heroin, ketamine, and speed, the original aficionados decried the bastardization of their sound and moved on to different electronic experiments. Reynolds does have some vivid passages of field research, such as his experience of one of Spiral Tribe's 20,000-strong raves in rural Castlemorton, but they can't compare to the E-fictions of Irvine Welsh (The Acid House) or Alan Warner (Morvern Callar). Although neither Reynolds nor anyone else can predict post-rave's future, his hard-core history of its first decade is a heady remix of the soundscape's greatest hits.

Selling seventy five thousand copies within a year of its publication in 1872, <i>Roughing It </i>was greeted as a work of "wild, preposterous invention and sublime exaggeration" whose satiric humor made "pretension and false dignity ridiculous." Meticulously restored from a variety of original sources, the text is the first to adhere to the author's wishes in thousands of details of wording, spelling, and punctuation, and includes all of the 304 first-edition illustrations. With its comprehensive and illuminating notes and supplementary materials, which include detailed maps tracing Mark Twain's western travels, this Mark Twain Library <i>Roughing It </i>must be considered the standard edition for readers and students of Mark Twain.</p><p>There is no nicer surprise for a reader than to discover that an acknowledged classic really does deliver the goods. Mark Twain's <i>Roughing It</i> is just such a book. The adventure tale is a delight from start to finish and is just as engrossing today as it was 125 years ago when it first appeared. <p> <i>Roughing It</i> tells the true-ish escapades of Twain in the American West. Although he clearly "speaks with forked tongue," <i>Roughing It</i> is informative as well as humorous. From stagecoach travel to the etiquette of prospecting, the modern reader gains considerable insight into that much-fictionalized time and place. Do you know about sagebrush, for example? </p><blockquote> Sage-brush is very fair fuel, but as a vegetable it is a distinguished failure. Nothing can abide the taste of it but the jackass and his illegitimate child, the mule. But their testimony to its nutritiousness is worth nothing, for they will eat pine knots, or anthracite coal, or brass filings, or lead pipe, or old bottles, or anything that comes handy, and then go off looking as grateful as if they had had oysters for dinner. </blockquote> <i>Roughing It</i> is informally structured around the narrator's attempts to strike it rich. He meets a motley, colorful crew in the process; many mishaps occur, and it shouldn't surprise you that Twain does not emerge a man of means. But he withstands it all in such a relentless good humor that his misfortune inspires laughter. <i>Roughing It</i> is wonderful entertainment and reminds you how funny the world can be--even its grimmer districts--when you're traveling with the right writer.12 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Through the Labyrinth: Designs and Meanings Over 5,000 Years</h2><p>Labyrinths and mazes are found all over the world, and have been a source of intrigue and wonder throughout history.

This is a kind of change which most men, bound and blinded by cast privilege, tend to resist; although-and also because-it promises to deepen their humanity, to free them from warping constraints, they by and large fear it. So the task of initiating these fast steps-the task of mobilizing human life-love and starting to outgrow the species-specific mental birth defect of which our uses of gender are part and our assault on the ecosphere an expression; the task of focusing human energy on protection of the lifeweb for whose fate we humans have by now, willy-nilly, made ourselves responsible-is a task, at this point, which rests largely in female hands. What happens next may well depend on us. (From: &#34;Survival on Earth: The Meaning of Feminism&#34; by Dorothy Dinnerstein)Because women have been the healers, nurturers and teachers of their loved ones, it seems appropriate (imperative) that we continue to awaken the offspring of the earth. There is an underlying partnership between every living thing; the environment is us. This beautiful collection of essays and poetry from women activists, writers and feminists who share this commitment, explores the link between women and nature in many cultures, exposes the abuses and prescribes ways of change. This is education for the uninformed and hope for the disheartened. -- <i>From The WomanSource Catalog &amp; Review: Tools for Connecting the Community for Women; review by SH</i></p><h2>Smoldering City: Chicagoans and the Great Fire, 1871-1874 (Historical Studies of Urban America)</h2><p><p>The fateful kick of Mrs. O'Leary's cow, the wild flight before the flames, the astonishingly quick rebuilding&#x2014;these are the well-known stories of the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. But as much as Chicago's recovery from disaster was a remarkable civic achievement, the Great Fire is also the story of a city's people divided and at odds. This is the story that Karen Sawislak tells so revealingly in this book.<br> <br> In a detailed account, drawn on memoirs, private correspondences, and other documents, Sawislak chronicles years of widespread, sometimes bitter, social and political conflict in the fire's wake, from fights over relief soup kitchens to cries against profiteering and marches on city hall by workers burned out of their homes. She shows how through the years of rebuilding the people of Chicago struggled to define civic order&#x2014;and the role that "good citizens" would play within it. As they rebuilt, she writes, Chicagoans confronted hard questions about charity and social welfare, work and labor relations, morality, and the limits of state power. Their debates in turn exposed the array of values and interests that different class, ethnic, and religious groups brought to these public discussions.<br> <br> "Sawislak combines the copious detail of a historian with the vivid portrayals of a storyteller in her investigation of the infamous Chicago fire. . . . Highlighted by historical maps, plates and engravings, with an epilogue and notes, <i>Smoldering City</i> presents an extremely thorough and engaging study of this extraordinary disaster."&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p></p><p>Karen Sawislak is assistant professor of history at Stanford University.Sawislak combines the copious detail of a historian with the vivid portrayals of a storyteller in her investigation of the infamous Chicago fire. Drawing historical accounts from one of the nation's first media frenzies, she examines the various philosophical debates the city faced after the fire in dealing with homelessness, the care and feeding of much of the population and the problem of rebuilding amidst political chaos and people working at cross purposes. She also explains the events that led up to the inferno. "Intensely dry conditions, a 20-m.p.h. southwest wind, and an unfortunate spark at approximately 10 o'clock on the night of October 8 all combined to turn Chicago into what two historians of the Great Fire would describe as 'a vast ocean of flame.'" The rift between the immigrant working class and the wealthy "native-born" Chicagoans made Catherine O'Leary (and her infamous bovine) a perfect scapegoat for anti-Irish, anti-working class invective. Highlighted by historical maps, plates and engravings, with an epilogue and notes, Smoldering City presents an extremely thorough and engaging study of this extraordinary disaster. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Cognition: Theory and Practice</h2><p>Cognition: Theory and Practice ISBN: 0716756676</p><p>RUSSELL REVLIN University of California, USA.</p><h2>Reading Dante (The Open Yale Courses Series)</h2><p>A towering figure in world literature, Dante wrote his great epic poem <i>Commedia</i> in the early fourteenth century. The work gained universal acclaim and came to be known as <i>La Divina Commedia</i>, or <i>The Divine Comedy</i>. Giuseppe Mazzotta brings Dante and his masterpiece to life in this exploration of the man, his cultural milieu, and his endlessly fascinating works. &nbsp; Based on Mazzotta&#x2019;s highly popular Yale course, this book offers a critical reading of <i>The Divine Comedy</i> and selected other works by Dante. Through an analysis of Dante&#x2019;s autobiographical <i>Vita nuova</i>, Mazzotta establishes the poetic and political circumstances of <i>The Divine Comedy</i>. He situates the three sections of the poem&#x2014;Inferno, Purgatory, Paradise&#x2014;within the intellectual and social context of the late Middle Ages, and he explores the political, philosophical, and theological topics&nbsp;with which Dante was particularly concerned.</p><p><b>Giuseppe&nbsp;Mazzotta</b> is Sterling Professor of Humanities in Italian, Yale University.

His version of the Comedy may be idiosyncratic, but his Dante has significant things to say that students might actually be intrigued by.&#34;-Peter Hainsworth, TLS</p><h2>Kidnapped &amp; Catriona (Wordsworth Children's Classics)</h2><p>Set in Scotland in 1751, Kidnapped tells of how young David Balfour, orphaned, and betrayed by his uncle Ebenezer who should have been his guardian, falls in with Alan Breck, the unscrupulous but heroic champion of the Jacobite cause. Shipwreck, murder and escape through the Highlands are only a few of the ingredients of this wonderful book.</p><p>Robert Louis Stevenson always considered &#34;Kidnapped,&#34; the tale of 17-year-old David Balfour&#39;s adventures in the remote islands and highlands of Scotland with renegade soldier Alan Breck Stewart, to be his greatest novel, but when the classic adventure tale was published in 1886, it was missing much of what its author held dear. His English publisher had excised many of the Scottish words and phrases he had used to evoke the suspense of the novel. From simple misreadings to deliberate revisions, subsequent printed editions represented major departures from Stevenson&#39;s handwritten text. Now Barry Menikoff has restored the author&#39;s language and punctuation, as well as the authentic Scots quality of his diction. In doing so, he has given readers a clearer picture of both Stevenson&#39;s skill as a storyteller and the novel&#39;s social and political context.For the better part of a century &#34;Kidnapped&#34; has occupied an ambiguous position in literary and cultural studies. Its initial appearance in a weekly magazine called &#34;Young Folks Paper,&#34; along with Stevenson&#39;s disingenuous comment that the novel had a diverting rather than a serious aim, have in effect trapped the book in the never-neverland of children&#39;s literature. Yet it is universally acknowledges as a classic of world literature and the novelist always considered it his finest achievement -- taken together with its sequel, &#34;David Balfour,&#34; the best he was capable of in fiction. Now, for the first readers can plainly see why Stevenson placed his story of David Balfour on so high a pedestal. Drawing on the unique autograph manuscript in California&#39;s Huntington Library, Professor Barry Menikoff faithfully reproduces the text as Stevenson originally wrote it, restoring the punctuation (of which the novelist was a master) and recovering the distinctive and often singular language that had been altered or deleted. The effect is to deepen and illuminate the Scottish texture of the novel. For a book so embedded in Scottish history as &#34;Kidnapped,&#34; so revelatory of its fierce loyalties and violent enmities, the discovery that Stevenson was even more nationalistic than we had known comes at an opportune moment, with the opening of the new Scottish parliament. This handsome new edition of a novel whose avowed purpose was the recovery of an important part of Scots history reproduces for the first time the original drawings that accompanied the text during its serialization in &#34;Young Folks.&#34; Professor Menikoff&#39;s substantial introduction situates the book in its cultural context, and enables us to see why Stevenson&#39;s contemporaries were both entranced and awed by his achievement. And in his extensive notes to the novel he reveals Stevenson&#39;s enormous prestige as an authority on language, both English and Scots, for &#34;Kidnapped&#34; was widely drawn upon as a reference by lexicographers for the &#34;Oxford English Dictionary&#34; and the &#34;Scottish National Dictionary.&#34; Finally, for a tale that charts the &#34;wanderings&#34; of David Balfour over the land and seas of Scotland, this edition is the first to provide a gazetteer of place-names encountered during the course of those travels.</p><h2>Vindication of the Rights of Woman and The Wrongs of Woman, or Maria (Longman Cultural Editions)</h2><p><p>From Longman's Cultural Editions series, <i>Wollstonecraft</i>, edited by Anne K.

Immediately recognisable by its daring yet subtle use of colour and brushmark to evoke the spirit of place, his work is to be found in public and private collections throughout the world.Newly available in paperback, this is the definitive study of Hitchens&#39; life and work. Peter Khoroche draws on the painter&#39;s published writings, correspondence and conversation to create a critical reappraisal of Hitchens&#39; theory and practice. He surveys the entire oeuvre (still-lifes, flower pieces, nudes, interiors and large-scale murals besides the landscapes), a huge legacy of work spanning sixty years, and charts the journey from conventional beginnings to &#39;figurative abstraction&#39;.A selection of over 100 colour images, examples of Hitchens&#39; best and most characteristic painting in all genres, provide a retrospective exhibition covering the artist&#39;s entire career. These illustrations, singled out for praise by reviewers of the hardback edition, demonstrate the artist&#39;s outstanding talents and reinforce his standing as a key figure in the history of British art.&#39; Peter Khoroche has shown how a passionately local idea became part of international modernism.&#39; TLS</p><p>Peter Khoroche wrote the catalogue for an exhibition of Hitchens&#39; paintings (Serpentine Gallery, London and tour 1989/90) and for an exhibition of Ben Nicholson&#39;s drawings and painted reliefs (Kettle&#39;s Yard, Cambridge and tour 2002/3).

I was amazed by the variety and complexity of microbes, and I loved drawing all of their intricate details and patterns.&#x201d; She lives in York, England.*Starred Review* Who wouldn&#x2019;t be fascinated by organisms that can eat anything: plants, animals (alive or dead), even oil and rocks? English biologist Davies introduces the strange realm of microbes: their minute sizes, their vast numbers, their diverse forms, and their varied roles in shaping our world. Simply written and concise, the text opens with comparisons that describe just how small these microorganisms are, noting that the picture of an ant would need to be as big as a whale in order for the millions of microbes on its antenna to be visible. While the analogy comparing the number of microbes in a teaspoon of soil to the population of India may be challenging for some young children to grasp, the colorful painting illustrating the idea could serve as a jumping-off point for further discussion. The information that some microbes cause illness is placed within the context of the many amazing things they accomplish. Reminiscent of Alice and Martin Provensen&#x2019;s artwork in its combination of formal structure and amiable tone, Sutton&#x2019;s large-scale illustrations help children to visualize microorganisms and processes that are too small to see. The sequence of simple images illustrating multiplying microbes is quite effective. A handsome and rewarding picture book about the power of tiny creatures.

It gives readers a comprehensive introduction to plane geometry in a historical context. <b> </b> Chapter topics include axiomatic systems, axiom sets for geometry, neutral geometry, Euclidean geometry of the plane, analytic and transformational geometry, non-Euclidean geometries, and projective geometry. <b> </b> For anyone in need of a refresher course in geometry. </p></p><p>This book provides a geometrical experience that unifies Euclidean concepts generally discussed in traditional high school geometry courses with various non-Euclidean views of the world. It offers the reader a &#34;map&#34; for a voyage through plane geometry and its various branches, as well as side-trips that discuss analytic and transformational geometry.<p> The goal of this book is to provide a geometric experience that clarifies, extends, and unifies concepts that are generally discussed in traditional high school geometry courses and to present additional topics which assist in gaining a better understanding of elementary geometry. As its title indicates, this book is designed to provide the reader with a "map" for a voyage through plane geometry and its various branches. As prerequisites, this book assumes only a prior course in high school geometry and the mathematical maturity usually provided by a semester of calculus or discrete mathematics. </p> <p> Preparations for our voyage begin in Chapter One with a discussion of the "Rules of the Road" during which time the reader is familiarized with the properties of axiomatic systems and the application of the axiomatic method to investigation of these systems. A discussion of several examples of finite and incidence geometries provides a framework upon which to investigate plane geometry. </p> <p> With preparations complete, our voyage actually begins in Chapter Two, where we are confronted with "Many Ways to Go." Here, within a historical perspective, we travel a variety of "roads" through plane geometry by investigating different axiomatic approaches to the study of Euclidean plane geometry. Axiomatic developments of geometry as proposed by Euclid, David Hilbert, G. D. Birkhoff, and the School Mathematics Study Group (SMSG) are compared and contrasted. A brief discussion of non-Euclidean geometries is also included. </p> <p> In Chapter Three, by "Traveling Together," we investigate the content of Neutral Geometry. The first fifteen of the SMSG postulates provide our pedagogical choice for a "main arterial" as we prepare ourselves to choose between the Euclidean and non-Euclidean "exits" that appear on the horizon. </p> <p> Chapter Four provides "One Way to Go" as we travel through Euclidean Plane Geometry. In this chapter we extend ideas developed in Neutral Geometry to provide a traditional look at the geometric topics of congruence, area, similarity, circles, triangles, and constructions from a Euclidean perspective. At the end of Chapter Four you will find a set of laboratory investigations that make use of Geometer's SketchPad� or Cabri II Geometry&#x2122; software. </p> <p> While still traveling through Euclidean Plane Geometry, Chapter Five offers "Side Trips" through analytical and transformational approaches to geometry. The real numbers, algebra, isometries, similarities, analytical transformations, and inversion and their applications to proving geom2tric theorems are discussed. </p> <p> In Chapter Six we consider "Other Ways to Go:" We return briefly to Neutral Geometry, in preparation for our venture into non-Euclidean Geometry. In addition to a discussion of hyperbolic geometry, this chapter contains a detailed description of the Poincare disk model and a brief excursion into elliptic geometry. Appendix E contains a collection of scripts, custom tools, and macros that allow for a dynamic investigation of the Poincare disk. Like Chapter Four, Chapter Six ends with a collection of laboratory activities that provide students with an opportunity to explore the hyperbolic plane first hand. </p> <p> Finally, in Chapter Seven, "All Roads Lead To... " projective geometry. Here we delve into a more general geometry than we have studied in previous chapters as we investigate the real projective plane in addition to the ideas of duality, perspectivity, and a brief look at projective transformations. </p> <p> New to the third edition of <i>Roads to Geometry</i> are enhanced problem sets at the end of each section and the inclusion of Laboratory Activities using Geometer's SketchPad� and Cabri II Geometry&#x2122; at the end of Chapter Four, Euclidean Geometry of the Plane, and of Chapter Six, Non-Euclidean Geometries. </p> <p> This text is appropriate for several kinds of students. Pre-service teachers of geometry are provided with a rigorous yet accessible treatment of plane geometry in a historical context. Mathematics majors will find its axiomatic development sufficiently rigorous to provide a foundation for further study in the areas of Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry. By using the SMSG postulate set as a basis for the development of plane geometry, we avoid the pitfalls of many "foundations of geometry" texts that encumber the reader with such a detailed development of preliminary results that many other substantive and elegant results are inaccessible in a one-semester course. </p> <p> The chapters of this book separate nicely into independent units. The material in Chapters One and Two provides preliminary groundwork for the study of geometry. Instructors who feel that their classes are exceptionally well prepared could omit these chapters in the interest of freeing time for material that is presented later in the book. Instructors teaching more typical classes will find the discussion of axiomatics in Chapter One and the comparisons of the various axiom sets in Chapter Two very helpful in conveying the notion of mathematical rigor. Instructors can teach a semester of Euclidean Geometry using Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Instructors more interested in nonEuclidean Geometries can opt to cover Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 6. </p> <p> At the end of each section is an ample collection of exercises of varying difficulty that provides problems that both extend and clarify results of that section, as well as problems that apply those results. At the end of each of chapters, Three through Seven, is a summary which lists all of the new definitions and theorems of that chapter. </p> <p> The authors gratefully acknowledge the following mathematicians who look of their time to review the current manuscript: David Bellamy, Univer',Bity of Delaware; Jack Tsui, Oakland University; Julia Wilson, State University College of New York at Fredonia; Peter Stiller, Texas A&amp;M University; Money Davidson, Kent University; Kimberly Cervello, State University College of New York at Geneseo; and Joel Zeitlin, California State University at Northridge. </p> <p> The authors hope that <i>Roads to Geometry</i> will in some way encourage the reader to more fully appreciate the marvelous worlds of Euclidean and non-Euclidean Geometry and to that end we wish you bon voyage. </p> <p> E.C.

Lewis Memorial Award for Caribbean Scholarship from the Caribbean Studies Association</p><p>Winner of the J.I. Staley Prize for Excellence in Anthropology from the School of American Research</p><p>Winner of the Albert J. Beveridge Award from the American Historical Association</p><p>In the early 18th century, the Dutch colony of Suriname was the envy of all others in the Americas. There, seven hundred Europeans lived off the labor of over four thousand enslaved Africans. Owned by men hell-bent for quick prosperity, the rich plantations on the Suriname river became known for their heights of planter comfort and opulence&#x2015;and for their depths of slave misery. Slaves who tried to escape were hunted by the planter militia. If found they were publicly tortured. (A common punishment was for the Achilles tendon to be removed for a first offense, the right leg amputated for a second.) Resisting this cruelty first in small numbers, then in an ever increasing torrent, slaves began to form outlaw communities until nearly one out of every ten Africans in Suriname was helping to build rebel villages in the jungle.</p><p><i>Alabi's World</i> relates the history of a nation founded by escaped slaves deep in the Latin American rain forest. It tells of the black men and women's bloody battles for independence, their uneasy truce with the colonial government, and the attempt of their great leader, Alabi, to reconcile his people with white law and a white God. In a unique historical experiment, Richard Price presents this history by weaving together four voices: the vivid historical accounts related by the slaves' descendants, largely those of Alabi's own villagers, the Saramaka; the reports of the often exasperated colonial officials sent to control the slave communities; the otherworldly diaries of the German Moravian missionaries determined to convert the heathen masses; and the historian's own, mediating voice. </p><p>The Saramaka voices in these pages recall a world of powerful spirits&#x2015;called <i>obia's</i>&#x2015;and renowned heroes, great celebrations and fierce blood-feuds. They also recall, with unconcealed relish, successes in confounding the colonial officials and in bending the treaty to the benefit of their own people. From the opposite side of the negotiations, the colonial Postholders speak of the futility of trying to hold the village leaders to their vow to return any further runaway slaves. Equally frustrated, the Moravian missionaries describe the rigors of their proselytising efforts in the black villages&#x2015;places of licentiousness and idol-worship that seemed to be "a foretaste of what hell must be like." Among their only zealous converts was Alabi, who stood nearly alone in his attempts to bridge the cultural gap between black and white&#x2015;defiantly working to lead his people on the path toward harmony with their former enemies. </p><p>From the confluence of these voices&#x2015;set throughout the book in four different typefaces&#x2015;Price creates a fully nuanced portrait of the collision of cultures. It is a confrontation, he suggests, that was enacted thousands of times across the slaveholding Americas as white men strained to suppress black culture and blacks resisted&#x2015; determined to preserve their heritage and beliefs.</p></p><p>Expanding the possibilities of historical writing, this multivocal narrative invites the reader to participate directly in the act of historical imagination. Richard Price is an expert guide through these first-hand accounts-as white colonists strain to suppress black culture, and blacks resist, determined to create and preserve their own distinctly Afro-American lifeways.<p><b>Richard Price </b> is the author of twelve books, including an earlier work on the Saramaka people, the award-winning <i>First Time: The Historical Vision of an Afro-American People</i>.

In refreshingly candid and straight-to-the-point language author Elissa Grodin takes readers of all ages on an A-Z trip through our government&#39;s structure, from its earliest beginnings to definitions of basic components and concepts (including immigration and taxation). Engaging, disarming, and frequently thought-provoking artwork from illustrator Victor Juhasz emphasizes the magnitude of the subject. From founding fathers, first ladies, and the First Amendment to the presidential oath of office, D is for Democracy details the political processes, parties, and people of democracy, American-style. Elissa D. Grodin grew up in a large family in Kansas City, Missouri, and was fifteen years old when she started to write short stories. While living in London in the late &#39;70s, she wrote for the Times Literary Supplement and New Statesman. After moving to New York, she studied at the School of Visual Arts and met her husband, actor Charles Grodin, while interviewing him for American Film magazine. D is for Democracy is her second children&#39;s book with Sleeping Bear Press. She also wrote N is for Nutmeg: A Connecticut Alphabet. Elissa lives with her family in Wilton, Connecticut. A graduate of the Parsons School of Design, Victor Juhasz began illustrating in 1974. His humorous illustrations and caricatures have been commissioned by major magazines, newspapers, advertising agencies, and book publishers both national and international, and his clients include Time, Newsweek, The New Yorker, Rolling Stone, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and GQ. Victor lives in Elizabeth, New Jersey.</p><p>Gr. 5-8. The organizing device for this book on the U.S and its government is the alphabet, with each letter introducing a person, place, thing, or concept. From "Amendment" and "Bill of Rights" to "You and me" and "Zeitgeist," each letter inspires a rhymed couplet about the topic, though some are a bit arcane: "X marks the spot / for a meeting one fall / of the very first Congress / in Philadelphia's Carpenter's Hall." The accompanying text includes two or three informative paragraphs written in polysyllabic words at a much higher reading level than the verse. The book's intended audience is a puzzle, as readers old enough to understand the text may well be put off by the alphabet theme and the verse. However, the broad appeal of Juhasz's colorful artwork is clear. Sure to please anyone from young children to adults, the drawings have an informal, accessible look bolstered by abundant energy, evident skill in caricature, and a sure sense of composition.

A hyperpluralism of religious and secular beliefs, an absence of any substantive common good, the triumph of capitalism and its driver, consumerism&#x2015;all these, Gregory argues, were long-term effects of a movement that marked the end of more than a millennium during which Christianity provided a framework for shared intellectual, social, and moral life in the West.</p><p>Before the Protestant Reformation, Western Christianity was an institutionalized worldview laden with expectations of security for earthly societies and hopes of eternal salvation for individuals. The Reformation&#x2019;s protagonists sought to advance the realization of this vision, not disrupt it. But a complex web of rejections, retentions, and transformations of medieval Christianity gradually replaced the religious fabric that bound societies together in the West. Today, what we are left with are fragments: intellectual disagreements that splinter into ever finer fractals of specialized discourse; a notion that modern science&#x2015;as the source of all truth&#x2015;necessarily undermines religious belief; a pervasive resort to a therapeutic vision of religion; a set of smuggled moral values with which we try to fertilize a sterile liberalism; and the institutionalized assumption that only secular universities can pursue knowledge.</p><p><i>The Unintended Reformation</i> asks what propelled the West into this trajectory of pluralism and polarization, and finds answers deep in our medieval Christian past.</p></p><p>Brad S. Gregory is Dorothy G. Griffin Professor of Early Modern European History at the University of Notre Dame.&#x201c;A strikingly brave and wide-ranging work, in which a distinguished historian of early modern Europe interprets the contemporary world. The precision and clarity with which Gregory lays out his evidence and the accuracy with which he handles materials in many different languages and of many different kinds give this original book extraordinary credibility. It's rare for a book to attain this level of scholarship nowadays. An astonishing achievement.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Anthony Grafton, author of <i>Worlds Made by Words</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A work of deep moral seriousness. Gregory's greatest contribution is his portrayal of the Reformation of Christianity as a central moment of disturbance and creativity in the modern Western world. In this endeavor, he has no equal among living authors. <i>The Unintended Reformation</i> is simply the most intelligent treatment of the subject by a contemporary author. It is also the most unconventional and most stirring engagement I know with the problem of how the West has dealt with its heritage of plural religions and concepts of values and happiness.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Thomas A. Brady, Jr., author of <i>German Histories in the Age of Reformations, 1400-1650</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Gregory's insightful and compelling narrative invites us to recognize the surprising extent to which we are still what the Protestant Reformation and its heirs made us, a society of conflicting and contested truth claims.

No one can doubt the central role that Luther, Calvin, and other reformers have played in the lives of Christians through the years...[Gregory] approaches the continuing impact of the Reformation in what he terms a "genealogical" approach--one that sees the Reformation as the root of a tree whose branches reach into every aspect of modern life. Rejecting the "supersessionist" view, that contemporary Christendom constitutes a radically new understanding of God and of the world itself, Gregory insists that our views, even our presuppositions, must be reimagined and re-evaluated in ways that demonstrate how the Reformation continues to reach into our theologies, our laws, our lives...[A] rewarding look at the long reach of history, and how we are the poorer for ignoring it.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[An] extraordinary new book...But however brilliant is Gregory's historical presentation (and it is brilliant), what ultimately distinguishes The Unintended Reformation is the sheer forcefulness of the narrative, which he pursues by examining the shift in perspectives on six distinct but interrelated themes since the sixteenth century: God, truth, institution, ethics, consumption and knowledge. The effect of this approach is to give the book an uncommon clarity: by going over what is essentially the single narrative in six different ways, each slight turn of the story illuminates the whole, and each new element comes across as both surprising and yet strangely familiar. The Unintended Reformation is unquestionably the most important contribution to the way we understand our present condition since Charles Taylor's A Secular Age. But it is also as a stinging rebuke to all those well-nigh fictitious accounts of the emergence of the enlightened West out of the intellectual darkness and decrepitude of the Middle Ages that now distort our collective self-perception. Let's hope Gregory's book wreaks havoc on some of these myths that we persist in telling ourselves.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Scott Stephens</b><b>, </b><b><i>Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Religion and Ethics blog</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;There could not be a more propitious moment for a book on greed and the historical roots of capitalism. Brad Gregory shows that historians have as much to contribute to contemporary debates about business and social ethics as most philosophers or economists...What is bold and unusual about The Unintended Reformation is that it comes from an explicitly Christian perspective and ends by arguing that only religion--properly understood as a doctrine of solidarity--can allow humanity to escape from the predicament of the modern, the material curse of poverty and the mental afflictions of prosperity. Gregory not only offers what is today a highly original combination of history and morality but also cogently explains why that combination is needed today.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Harold James</b><b>, </b><b><i>Financial Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This book is truly breathtaking in its scope, erudition and sheer nerve. There is no faulting Gregory's grasp of Reformation history, but to his analysis of what has happened since there could be many objections raised. This is relatively unimportant, however. Max Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism was not completely right either, but it was brilliant nevertheless. Gregory's is a work not just of genuine scholarship but also of sincere moral purpose, which, even if it annoys, frustrates or fails to convince, has opened up an immensely important debate. There may yet be time to fix some of what went wrong in the Reformation.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Lucy Wooding</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Higher Education</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Restrained and erudite...Apart from furnishing an interesting and well written account of the Reformation, the book is perhaps most interesting when [Gregory] grapples with his opponents...[A] thought-provoking book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Nick Carn</b><b>, </b><b><i>Financial World</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A lucidly written and far-reaching analysis that shows how the contemporary Western world continues to be influenced by the complex transformations that occurred in the 16th and 17th centuries.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>J.

This catalog is the most comprehensive volume on the artist now available.<br><br> Jane Livingston's extensively researched biographical essay covers Diebenkorn's entire career and concentrates on the artist's inner life and purposes as revealed in his paintings. Ruth Fine deals primarily with the figurative aspect of Diebenkorn's work (1955-67), and John Elderfield concentrates on the Ocean Park period (1967-93). All three authors provide valuable insights based on their personal relationships with the artist and his widow, Phyllis. On both page and canvas, the reader can sense Diebenkorn's complexity and highly self-conscious working methods, as well as his formidable integrity.<br><br> <i>The Art of Richard Diebenkorn</i> will give readers with an interest in all phases of modernism new thoughts about the relationship between abstraction and representation. Stunningly illustrated, with 192 full-color reproductions, this book is an exhilarating testament to a distinctive American artist.</p><p>On the process of painting, American painter Richard Diebenkorn once wrote, "I want painting to be difficult to do. The more obstacles, obstructions, problems ... the better." In part, he meant that the freest artistic expression was often the result of some sort of restraint. Much like Shakespeare writing within the rigorous poetic form of the sonnet, Diebenkorn found his format in the vertical, rectangular, human-size canvases that he used to paint his famed Ocean Park series, which occupied a large portion of his magnificent career and included many figurative works. This sequence consists of more than 100 paintings created primarily over the course of the 1970s. There is a tranquil, mystical quality to his works: geometric lines define fields of color evoking the tones, landscape, atmosphere, and quality of light in Ocean Park. His paintings thus hover on the boundary between abstraction and landscape. <p> This paperback exhibition catalog of the retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City contains a beautifully produced plate section, arranged chronologically, that spans nearly the entire second half of the 20th century. A special highlight are Diebenkorn's notes to himself on beginning a painting.</p><b>Jane Livingston</b> is an independent author and curator living in Rappahannock County, Virginia. <b>John Elderfield</b> is Chief Curator-at-Large at The Museum of Modern Art. <b>Ruth Fine</b> is Curator of Modern Prints and Drawings at the National Gallery.</p><h2>Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase &amp; Fable, 18th edition</h2><p>A latest edition of the flagship title originally published in 1870 provides hundreds of new facts on urban myths ranging from designer babies to sewer-dwelling alligators.</p><p>No Bio<br><br>No Bio</p><h2>Houghton Mifflin English: Workbook Plus Teacher&#39;s Annotated Edition Grade 5</h2><p>English Grade 5 Workbook Plus Teacher&#39;s Annotated Edition</p><p></p><h2>Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes and Selected Travel Writings (The World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>This volume of Stevenson&#39;s travel writings--the only collection in print--includes his first published book, An Inland Voyage (1878), a vivid account of a canoe voyage in Belgium and France in two sail-powered skiffs, and his popular description of a tour with his recalcitrant donkey Modestine in Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes (1879).

This new edition reproduces the last edition of the novel supervised by Gaskell. The introduction provides historical and biographical context to the novel, a survey of critical responses to Mary Barton, and argues that Gaskell was chiefly concerned with the importance of communication as a means of healing breaches between people.

Gaskell&#x2019;s work had great importance to the labour and reform movements, and it influenced writers such as Charles Dickens, Thomas Carlyle and Charlotte Bront�. </p> <p> The plot of Mary Barton concerns the poverty and desperation of England&#x2019;s industrial workers. Fundamentally, however, it revolves around Mary&#x2019;s personal conflicts. She is already divided between an affection for an industrialist&#x2019;s son, Henry Carson, and for a man of her own class, Jem Wilson. But Mary&#x2019;s conflict escalates when her father, a committed trade unionist, is asked to assassinate Henry, who is the son of his unjust employer. </p></p><h2>Feminist Epistemologies (Thinking Gender)</h2><p>First published in 1993.

Grain elevators are towering structures in the flat, vast landscape of the world's granaries. Providing a fast and efficient method of loading and unloading grain to keep pace with the industrial production methods of the nineteenth century, they made possible a tremendous increase in the trafficking and processing of grain.

Monumental, essential, and visually arresting, grain elevators belong as much to the American imagination and landscape as to the European.

The grape, grown predominantly in California, has acquired an almost mythic status&#x2015;in part because of the caliber of its wines and its remarkable versatility, and in part because of the mystery surrounding its origins. Charles Sullivan, a leading expert on the history of California wine, has at last written the definitive history of Zinfandel. Here he brings together his deep knowledge of wine with the results of his extensive research on the grape in the United States and Europe in a book that will entertain and enlighten wine aficionados and casual enthusiasts. In this lively book, Sullivan dispels the false legend that has obscured Zinfandel's history for almost a century, reveals the latest scientific findings about the grape's European roots, shares his thoughts on the quality of the wines now being produced, and looks to the future of this remarkable grape. <br><br>Sullivan reconstructs Zinfandel's journey through history&#x2015;taking us from Austria to the East Coast of the U.S. in the 1820s, to Gold Rush California, and through the early days of the state's wine industry. He considers the ups and downs of the grape's popularity, including its most recent and, according to Sullivan, most brilliant "up." He also unravels the two great mysteries surrounding Zinfandel: the myth of Agoston Haraszthy's role in importing Zinfandel, and the heated controversy over the relationship between California Zinfandel and Italian Primitivo. Sullivan ends with his assessments of the 2001 and 2002 vintages, firmly setting the history of Zinfandel into the chronicles of grape history.</p><p>"A lively, well-researched and entertaining account of California's favorite grape. Illuminating."&#x2015;Gerald Asher, author of <i>The Pleasures of Wine</i><br><br>"The Zinfandel grape makes a fine wine. The story of its development also recapitulates and epitomizes the history of California from the Mission Era to the present. Enjoy, then, Charles Sullivan's masterful chronicle of the grape and the wine that best bespeak the sun, the soil, the hillside vineyards, the joy of life that is our beloved California!"&#x2015;Dr. Kevin Starr, State Librarian of California<br><br>"The mystery of Zinfandel has always had two sides: historical and scientific. As Charles Sullivan relates, the science has now been demystified by Dr. Carole Meredith of the University of California at Davis.

Charles Sullivan lovingly blends California wine lore, primary source research and personal history into a thoughtful, compelling and thoroughly enjoyable chronicle of the Zinfandel-tainted California wine trade.

The details of theatrical techniques and stage directions, used by playwrights to highlight key moments, are drawn out and related to the meaning of each play as a whole.

Naumov</b> is director of the Moscow archive RGASPI.This documentary collection, continuing Yale's pioneering Annals of Communism series, tackles questions surrounding the paroxysm of the purges in 1937^-38. One thing Stalin had was a long memory, and the hitherto mysterious Riutin Platform (the contents here at last seeing the light) must have rankled him. The platform was a 1932 call by Bolshevik veterans to remove him. The course culminating in the extirpation of all opposition was complex, and the authors' commentary underscores that a politics of sorts continued up to the point when full-blown terror was unleashed, a politics that pitted the central apparatus of Stalin and his associates in Moscow against the regional party bosses. The authors track one such Stalinist's fate in detail, as they do that of Bukharin, Stalin's opponent in the 1920s.

When Larry Hart first met Dick Rodgers in 1919, the commercial song lyric consisted of tired cliches and cloying Victorian sentimentality. Hart changed all that, always avoiding the obvious, aiming for the unexpected phrase that would twang the nerve or touch the heart. Endowed with both a buoyant wit and a tender, almost raw sincerity, Hart brought a poetic complexity to his art, capturing the everyday way people talk and weaving it into his lyrics. Songs had never been written like that before, and afterwards it seemed impossible that songs would ever be written any other way.<br> <em>Lorenz Hart: A Poet on Broadway</em> presents the public triumphs of a true genius of the American musical theatre, and the personal tragedies of a man his friend the singer Mabel Mercer described as "the saddest man I ever knew." Author Frederick Nolan began researching this definitive biography in 1968, tracking down and interviewing Hart's friends and collaborators one by one, including a remarkable conversation with Richard Rodgers himself. A veritable who's who of Broadway's golden age, including Joshua Logan, Gene Kelly, George Abbott and many more, recall their uncensored and often hilarious, sometimes poignant memories of the cigar-chomping wordsmith who composed some of the best lyrics ever concocted for the Broadway stage, but who remained forever lost and lonely in the crowds of hangers-on he attracted. A portrait of Hart emerges as a Renaissance and endearing <em>bon vivant</em> conflicted by his homosexuality and ultimately torn apart by alcoholism.<br> Nolan skillfully pulls together the chaotic details of Hart's remarkable life, beginning with his bohemian upbringing in turn of the century Harlem. Here are his first ventures into show business, and the 24-year-old Hart's first meeting with the 16-year-old Richard Rodgers. "Neither of us mentioned it," Rodgers later recalled, "but we evidently knew we would work together, and I left Hart's house having acquired in one afternoon a career, a best friend, and a source of permanent irritation." Nolan captures it all: the team's early setbacks, the spectacular hour long standing ovation for their hit song, "Manhattan," the Hollywood years (which inspired Hart to utter the undying line, "Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean the bastards aren't out to get you"), and the unforgettable string of hit shows that included "On Your Toes," "The Boys from Syracuse," and their masterpiece, "Pal Joey." But while success made Rodgers more confident, more musically daring, and more disciplined, for Hart the rounds of parties, wisecracks, and most of all drinking began to take more and more of a toll on his work. When Hart's unreliability forced Rodgers to reluctantly seek out another lyricist, Oscar Hammerstein II, and their collaboration resulted in the unprecedented artistic and commercial success of "Oklahoma," Hart never truly recovered.<br> Meticulously researched and rich with anecdotes that capture the excitement, the hilarity, the dizzying heights, and the crushing lows of a life on Broadway, <em>Lorenz Hart</em> is the story of an American original.<br></p><p><br><strong>Frederick Nolan</strong> is the author of the acclaimed biography <em>Rodgers and Hammerstein: The Sound of their Music</em>.<br>An old-fashioned Broadway biography of Richard Rodgers's first lyricist. Nolan (The Sound of Their Music: The Story of Rodgers and Hammerstein, 1978) presents a ``this-is-your-life'' account of Lorenz Hart's rise and fall. Born in 1895 to Jewish immigrant parents in New York City's Harlem, Hart was raised in a boisterous household by a loving mother and a ne'er-do-well father who specialized in elaborate business scams. After directing amateur theatricals at summer camp, Hart began working on student revues at Columbia, where he met a young piano player named Richard Rodgers. Through classmate Herb Fields, then an aspiring writer, they were introduced to Fields's father, Lew, a theatrical impresario, who gave them their first break. After several abortive stabs at writing for Broadway, the partners were so unsure of their eventual success that Rodgers was tempted by an offer to sell babies' underwear just before their first big hit, a score for the Theater Guild's Garrick Gaieties of 1935. Rodgers and Hart went on to create many well-known musicals, including Babes in Arms, I Married an Angel, The Boys from Syracuse, and the great Pal Joey. Along the way, Hart pushed for lyrics--witty, cosmopolitan, full of current slang and topical allusions--whose quality was a notch above the ``moon-June-spoon'' fare of previous popular songs; he also insisted that songs be an integral part of the play, not just interpolations to suit a particular singing star. The writer was dogged by low self-esteem and a homosexual bent that Nolan seems most uncomfortable discussing; Hart eventually became so addicted to late-night carousing that he aggravated his more prudish partner. Rodgers finally paired up with Oscar Hammerstein shortly before Hart's death in 1943 to compose the immortal Oklahoma!, which launched the modern musical era. A sympathetic account for fans of the musical theater of the '30s and '40s. (15 b&amp;w photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In fact, statistics show that by the year 2100, half of the United States population may be Latino. And two of every three of America&#39;s Latinos are Mexican. Mexicans are the oldest settelers of the United States, and they are also the nation&#39;s largest group of recent immigrant arrivals. Their population is increasing faster than that of all other Latino groups combined.

When he is involved in a freak accident in the Bronx, prosecutors, politicians, the press, the police, the clergy, and assorted hustlers high and low close in on him, licking their chops and giving us a gargantuan helping of the human comedy, of New York in the 1980s, a city boiling over with racial and ethnic hostilities and burning with the itch to Grab It Now. Wolfe's novel is a big, panoramic story of the metropolis that reinforces the author's reputation as the foremost chronicler of the way we live in America.<br></p><p>After Tom Wolfe defined the '60s in <i>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test</i> and <i>Radical Chic and Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers</i> and the cultural U-turn at the turn of the '80s in <i>The Right Stuff</i>, nobody thought he could ever top himself again. In 1987, when <i>The Bonfire of the Vanities</i> arrived, the literati called Wolfe an "aging enfant terrible."<p> He wasn't aging; he was growing up. <i>Bonfire</i>'s pyrotechnic satire of 1980s New York wasn't just Wolfe's best book, it was the best bestselling fiction debut of the decade, a miraculously realistic study of an unbelievably status-mad society, from the fiery combatants of the South Bronx to the bubbling scum at the top of Wall Street. Sherman McCoy, a farcically arrogant investment banker (dubbed a "Master of the Universe," Wolfe's brilliant metaphorical co-opting of a then-important toy for boys), hits a black guy in the Bronx with his Mercedes and runs--right into a nightmare peopled by vicious mistresses, thin wives like "social x-rays," slime-bag politicos, tabloid hacks, and Dantesque denizens of the "justice" system. If the Coen and Marx brothers together dramatized <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, Wolfe's <i>Bonfire</i> would probably be funnier. Many think his second novel, <i>A Man in Full</i>, is deeper, but <i>Bonfire</i> will never die down.</p><p> You might find it interesting to compare the film <i>The Bonfire of the Vanities</i>, a fascinating calamity perpetrated by the geniuses Brian De Palma and Tom Hanks, with <i>The Right Stuff</i>, one of the very best films of the '80s. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>"A big, bitter, funny, craftily plotted book that grabs you by the lapels and won't let go."<br>--<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><p>"It's the human comedy, on a skyscraper scale and at a taxi-meter pace . . . .

S. Carroll, Berkshire, UK, Chromatographia, July 2011. (S. Carroll <i>Chromatographia</i>)</p><h2>The Great Indian Novel</h2><p>In this widely acclaimed novel, Shashi Tharoor has masterfully recast the two-thousand-year-old epic &#34;The Mahabharata&#34; with fictionalized - but highly recognizable - events and characters from twentieth-century Indian politics. Blending history and myth to chronicle the Indian struggle for freedom and independence, Tharoor directs his hilarious and often outrageous satire as much against Indian foibles and failings as against the bumblings of the British rulers. Despite its regional setting, this work can be enjoyed by readers unfamiliar with Indian history.</p><p>Shashi Tharoor was born in London and brought up in Bombay and Calcutta. A winner of the Commonwealth Writers Prize, he is the interim head of the Department of Public Information of the United Nations.The delightfully suspect and satirical tone of Tharoor's title informs and enlivens his monumental tale. In an opening disclaimer, the author cites the Mahabharata , an ancient Hindu epic, as the source of his inspiration. The story he retells, however, is also a thinly veiled account of the people and events that shaped India during the struggle for independence from British rule. Tharoor recasts these in a mythological, fictive realm, skillfully interweaving elements of traditional Eastern and Western literature. The epic, the sonnet, the novel and the folk tale all help to shape the narrative, just as history and myth, dream and reality intertwine in every chapter, calling into question the validity of categories. "One must be wary of history by anecdote," warns the narrator; one must be wary of "history" itself, suggests Tharoor. Despite his stereotypical treatment of British and Indian characters, he animates history with the imagination of an artist and the philosophy of a sage.

Jacqueline Jones Royster and Gesa E. Kirsch contend the field of rhetorical studies is being transformed through the work of feminist rhetoricians who have brought about notable changes in who the subjects of rhetorical study can be, how their practices can be critiqued, and how the effectiveness and value of the inquiry frameworks can be articulated.<p>To contextualize a new and changed landscape for narratives in the history of rhetoric, Royster and Kirsch present four critical terms of engagement&#x2014;critical imagination, strategic contemplation, social circulation, and globalization&#x2014;as the foundation for a new analytical model for understanding, interpreting, and evaluating feminist rhetorical inquiry and the study and teaching of rhetoric in general. This model draws directly on the wealth of knowledge and understanding gained from feminist rhetorical practices, especially sensitivity toward meaningfully and respectfully rendering the work, lives, cultures, and traditions of historical and contemporary women in rhetorical scholarship.</p><p>Proposing ambitious new standards for viewing and valuing excellence in feminist rhetorical practice, Royster and Kirsch advocate an ethos of respect and humility in the analysis of communities and specific rhetorical performances neglected in rhetorical history, recasting rhetorical studies as a global phenomenon rather than a western one. They also reflect on their own personal and professional development as researchers as they highlight innovative feminist research over the past thirty years to articulate how feminist work is changing the field and pointing to the active participation of women in various discourse arenas and to the practices and genres they use.</p><p>Valuable to new and established scholars of rhetoric, <i>Feminist Rhetorical Practice: New Horizons for Rhetoric, Composition, and Literacy Studies </i>is essential for understanding the theoretical, methodological, and ethical impacts of feminist rhetorical studies on the wider field.<br><br> Winner, 2014 Winifred Bryan Horner Outstanding Book Award</p></p><p>Jacqueline Jones Royster is a professor of English and Dean of the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts at the Georgia Institute of Technology.&nbsp;Her previous books include&nbsp;Southern Horrors and Other Writings:&nbsp;The Anti-Lynching Campaign of Ida B.

Part 2, &#x201c;Re-visioning History, Theory, and Practice,&#x201d; reviews the literature of the last quarter century, highlighting changes from the formerly hegemonic Western white male point of view. Part 3, &#x201c;Recasting Paradigms for Inquiry, Analysis, and Interpretation,&#x201d; most interestingly dissects the methods inherent in various feminist scholars&#x2019; work, expands on their methods, and provides a &#x201c;how to&#x201d; on emulating them.

The New Yorker magazine has met this challenge more often and more successfully--and more originally and more surprisingly--than any other modern American journal. <br><br>Starting with its light fantastic evocations of the glamorous and the idiosyncratic in the twenties and continuing to the present, with complex pictures of such contemporaries as Mikhail Baryshnikov and Richard Pryor, The New Yorker's Profiles have presented readers with a vast and brilliant portrait gallery of our day and age. These literary-journalistic investigations into character and accomplishment, motive and madness, beauty and ugliness, are unrivaled in their range, variety of style, and embrace of humanity.<br><br>To help mark the occasion of The New Yorker's seventy-fifth anniversary, <b>Life Stories</b> puts into one volume, for the first time, some of the most outstanding examples of this exemplary tradition. Here you will find Wolcott Gibbs on Henry Luce, Lillian Ross on Ernest Hemingway, and Susan Orlean on show dog Biff Truesdale. And in some of the exhibit's many other rooms you will find startling likenesses of Marlon Brando by Truman Capote, magician Ricky Jay by Mark Singer, pitcher Steve Blass by Roger Angell, and Anatole Broyard by Henry Louis Gates, Jr.<br><br>When they were first published in the magazine, these essential biographies brought insight, amusement, understanding, and, often, joy or sorrow to those who read them. Gathered together here, in Life Stories, they provide us with an album of our era, a rich and diverse appraisal of some of the most prominent members of an entire century's cast.</p><p>Way back in 1926 the founding editor of <i>The New Yorker</i> suggested that the title <i>Profiles</i> be registered with the copyright bureau. Harold Ross had ample reason, for though he didn't invent the word itself, he certainly invested it with new significance. Over the years, <i>New Yorker</i> Profiles came to represent a new kind of biography: concise, well-researched, and impeccably written sketches of personalities who were often famous--but just as often not. Take for example "Mr. Hunter's Grave," Joseph Mitchell's 1956 Profile of George H. Hunter, the 87-year-old chairman of the board of trustees of the African Methodist church on Staten Island. This delightful piece leads off a select group of Profiles culled from <i>The New Yorker</i>'s first 75 years and collected in <i>Life Stories</i>, edited by David Remnick. More a study of a place and a way of life than of a particular man, Mitchell's Profile stretched the parameters of the form. <p> The very next piece, Mark Singer's "Secrets of the Magus," is a prime example of what <i>The New Yorker</i> does best. In Ricky Jay, "perhaps the most gifted sleight-of-hand artist alive," Singer has hit on a quirky, eccentric, and fascinating subject--one that offers plenty of scope for writer and reader alike to dip into an arcane and little-known world of magicians, mountebanks, card handlers, and confidence men. Alva Johnston achieves similar success in "The Education of a Prince," his 1932 Profile of con man Harry F. Gerguson, who spent years masquerading as the lost Prince Michael Alexandrovitch Dmitry Obolensky Romanoff: </p><blockquote> The Prince had a glittering career in New York, Boston, Newport, on Long Island, in high-caste settlements along the Hudson, and among the aristocracies of a dozen American cities. Twice he swept over Hollywood in a confetti shower of bad checks. He was repeatedly exposed, but exposure does not embarrass him greatly. He is widely admired today, not for his title but for his own sake. He has convinced a fairly large public that a good imposter is preferable to the average prince. </blockquote> Of course <i>The New Yorker</i> covered plenty of household names, as well, and <i>Life Stories</i> contains sketches of such celebrities as Mikhail Baryshnikov, Johnny Carson, Richard Pryor and Marlon Brando. The arts are well represented by pieces on Ernest Hemingway, Anatole Broyard, and David Salle, and even the contributors are stellar, including such well-known scribes as Henry Louis Gates Jr., Truman Capote, and John McPhee. <p> But where is that famous Profile of the sea by Rachel Carson, you ask? Pauline Kael's piece on Cary Grant or Janet Malcolm's controversial study of psychoanalyst Aaron Green? In his introduction Remnick acknowledges the many great Profiles that did not make it into this volume, explaining that he decided to publish pieces only in full. "I wanted the reader to get the real thing--no excerpts, no snippets," he writes. "As a result the reader will have to go elsewhere for a range of long or multipart Profiles." What's here is choice, though, and die-hard <i>New Yorker</i> aficionados who turn to the Profiles even before perusing the cartoons won't be disappointed by what they find. All in all, <i>Life Stories</i> makes a fine 75th anniversary bouquet for the magazine's many devoted readers. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p><br><b>Shown Here in Profiles</b><br><br>"He scans the assembly, his eyes twinkling like icicles.

This great wolf is just one of the animals whose true stories come to life in this engrossing collection of tales by celebrated naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton. Combining scientific observations of animals in their natural habitats with a romantic vision of nature and the narrative skills of a born storyteller, Seton created an extraordinary collection of tales that gave the animal story new force and believability as a literary genre. Critically and popularly acclaimed upon its initial appearance in 1898,<i>&nbsp;</i>this collection<i>&nbsp;</i>remains, more than a century later, the best-known and best-loved of his works. Each tale focuses on an individual creature: the clever crow, Silverspot; Raggylug, a young cottontail rabbit; the author&#x2019;s errant hound, Bingo; Redruff, a Don Valley partridge; a wild horse known as The Mustang; Vixen, The Springfield Fox; and Wully, faithful sheep dog by day and treacherous killer by night. Seton offers affectionate but realistic portraits of each animal, stressing the commonality between his subjects and their human neighbors. In addition to his popular wildlife stories, the author is well known for his work as an illustrator and painter. This edition faithfully reproduces the layout of the original volume, as well as all 200 of the author&#x2019;s distinctive illustrations.</p><p><b>Ernest Thompson Seton</b> (1860&#x2013;1946) was an author and a naturalist.&nbsp;<b>Lobo</b><br><b>The King of Currumpaw</b><br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>I<br>&nbsp;<br>Currumpaw is a vast cattle range in northern New Mexico. It is a land of rich pastures and teeming flocks and herds, a land of rolling mesas and precious running waters that at length unite in the Currumpaw River, from which the whole region is named. And the king whose despotic power was felt over its entire extent was an old gray wolf.<br>&nbsp;<br>Old Lobo, or the king, as the Mexicans called him, was the gigantic leader of a remarkable pack of gray wolves, that had ravaged the Currumpaw Valley for a number of years. All the shepherds and ranchmen knew him well, and, wherever he appeared with his trusty band, terror reigned supreme among the cattle, and wrath and despair among their owners. Old Lobo was a giant among wolves, and was cunning and strong in proportion to his size. His voice at night was well-known and easily distinguished from that of any of his fellows. An ordinary wolf might howl half the night about the herdsman's bivouac without attracting more than a passing notice, but when the deep roar of the old king came booming down the ca�on, the watcher bestirred himself and prepared to learn in the morning that fresh and serious inroads had been made among the herds.<br>&nbsp;<br>Old Lobo's band was but a small one. This I never quite understood, for usually, when a wolf rises to the position and power that he had, he attracts a numerous following. It may be that he had as many as he desired, or perhaps his ferocious temper prevented the increase of his pack. Certain is it that Lobo had only five followers during the latter part of his reign. Each of these, however, was a wolf of renown, most of them were above the ordinary size, one in particular, the second in command, was a veritable giant, but even he was far below the leader in size and prowess. Several of the band, besides the two leaders, were especially noted. One of those was a beautiful white wolf, that the Mexicans called Blanca; this was supposed to be a female, possibly Lobo's mate. Another was a yellow wolf of remarkable swiftness, which, according to current stories had, on several occasions, captured an antelope for the pack.<br>&nbsp;<br>It will be seen, then, that these wolves were thoroughly well-known to the cowboys and shepherds. They were frequently seen and oftener heard, and their lives were intimately associated with those of the cattlemen, who would so gladly have destroyed them. There was not a stockman on the Currumpaw who would not readily have given the value of many steers for the scalp of any one of Lobo's band, but they seemed to possess charmed lives, and defied all manner of devices to kill them. They scorned all hunters, derided all poisons, and continued, for at least five years, to exact their tribute from the Currumpaw ranchers to the extent, many said, of a cow each day. According to this estimate, therefore, the band had killed more than two thousand of the finest stock, for, as was only too well-known, they selected the best in every instance.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>The old idea that a wolf was constantly in a starving state, and therefore ready to eat anything, was as far as possible from the truth in this case, for these freebooters were always sleek and well-conditioned, and were in fact most fastidious about what they ate. Any animal that had died from natural causes, or that was diseased or tainted, they would not touch, and they even rejected anything that had been killed by the stockmen. Their choice and daily food was the tenderer part of a freshly killed yearling heifer. An old bull or cow they disdained, and though they occasionally took a young calf or colt, it was quite clear that veal or horseflesh was not their favorite diet. It was also known that they were not fond of mutton, although they often amused themselves by killing sheep. One night in November, 1893, Blanca and the yellow wolf killed two hundred and fifty sheep, apparently for the fun of it, and did not eat an ounce of their flesh.<br>&nbsp;<br>These are examples of many stories which I might repeat, to show the ravages of this destructive band. Many new devices for their extinction were tried each year, but still they lived and throve in spite of all the efforts of their foes. A great price was set on Lobo's head, and in consequence poison in a score of subtle forms was put out for him, but he never failed to detect and avoid it. One thing only he feared &#x2013; that was firearms, and knowing full well that all men in this region carried them, he never was known to attack or face a human being. Indeed, the set policy of his band was to take refuge in flight whenever, in the daytime, a man was descried, no matter at what distance. Lobo's habit of permitting the pack to eat only that which they themselves had killed, was in numerous cases their salvation, and the keenness of his scent to detect the taint of human hands or the poison itself, completed their immunity.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>On one occasion, one of the cowboys heard the too familiar rallying-cry of Old Lobo, and stealthily approaching, he found the Currumpaw pack in a hollow, where they had 'rounded up' a small herd of cattle. Lobo sat apart on a knoll, while Blanca with the rest was endeavoring to 'cut out' a young cow, which they had selected; but the cattle were standing in a compact mass with their heads outward, and presented to the foe a line of horns, unbroken save when some cow, frightened by a fresh onset of the wolves, tried to retreat into the middle of the herd. It was only by taking advantage of these breaks that the wolves had succeeded at all in wounding the selected cow, but she was far from being disabled, and it seemed that Lobo at length lost patience with his followers, for he left his position on the hill and, uttering a deep roar, dashed toward the herd. The terrified rank broke at his charge, and he sprang in among them. Then the cattle scattered like the pieces of a bursting bomb. Away went the chosen victim, but ere she had gone twenty-five yards Lobo was upon her. Seizing her by the neck he suddenly held back with all his force and so threw her heavily to the ground. The shock must have been tremendous, for the heifer was thrown heels over head. Lobo also turned somersault, but immediately recovered himself, and his followers falling on the poor cow, killed her in a few seconds. Lobo took no part in the killing &#x2013; after having thrown the victim, he seemed to say, "Now, why could not some of you have done that at once without wasting so much time?"<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>The man now rode up shouting, the wolves as usual retired, and he, having a bottle of strychnine, quickly poisoned the carcass in three places, then went away, knowing they would return to feed, as they had killed the animal themselves. But next morning, on going to look for his expected victims, he found that, although the wolves had eaten the heifer, they had carefully cut out and thrown aside all those parts that had been poisoned.<br>&nbsp;<br>The dread of this great wolf spread yearly among the ranchmen, and each year a larger price was set on his head, until at last it reached $1,000, an unparalleled wolf-bounty, surely; many a good man has been hunted down for less. Tempted by the promised reward, a Texan ranger named Tannerey came one day galloping up the ca�on of the old Currumpaw. He had a superb outfit for wolf-hunting &#x2013; the best of guns and horses, and a pack of enormous wolf-hounds. Far out on the plains of the Pan-handle, he and his dogs had killed many a wolf, and now he never doubted that, within a few days, old Lobo's scalp would dangle at his saddle-bow.<br>&nbsp;<br>Away they went bravely on their hunt in the gray dawn of a summer morning, and soon the great dogs gave joyous tongue to say that they were already on the track of their quarry. Within two miles, the grizzly band of Currumpaw leaped into view, and the chase grew fast and furious. The part of the wolf-hounds was merely to hold the wolves at bay till the hunter could ride up and shoot them, and this usually was easy on the open plains of Texas; but here a new feature of the country came into play, and showed how well Lobo had chosen his range; for the rocky ca�ons of the Currumpaw and its tributaries intersect the prairies in every direction. The old wolf at once made for the nearest of these and by crossing it got rid of the horsemen. His band then scattered and thereby scattered the dogs, and when they reunited at a distant point of course all of the dogs did not turn up, and the wolves no longer outnumbered, turned on their pursuers and killed or desperately wounded them all. That night when Tannerey mustered his dogs, only six of them returned, and of these, two were terribly lacerated. This hunter made two other attempts to capture the royal scalp, but neither of them was more successful than the first, and on the last occasion his best horse met its death by a fall; so he gave up the chase in disgust and went back to Texas, leaving Lobo more than ever the despot of the region.<br>&nbsp;<br>Next year, two other hunters appeared, determined to win the promised bounty. Each believed he could destroy this noted wolf, the first by means of a newly devised poison, which was to be laid out in an entirely new manner; the other a French Canadian, by poison assisted with certain spells and charms, for he firmly believed that Lobo was a veritable 'loupgarou,' and could not be killed by ordinary means. But cunningly compounded poisons, charms, and incantations were all of no avail against this grizzly devastator. He made his weekly rounds and daily banquets as aforetime, and before many weeks had passed, Calone and Laloche gave up in despair and went elsewhere to hunt.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the spring of 1893, after his unsuccessful attempt to capture Lobo, Joe Calone had a humiliating experience, which seems to show that the big wolf simply scorned his enemies, and had absolute confidence in himself. Calone's farm was on a small tributary of the Currumpaw, in a picturesque ca�on, and among the rocks of this very ca�on, within a thousand yards of the house, old Lobo and his mate selected their den and raised their family that season. There they lived all summer, and killed Joe's cattle, sheep, and dogs, but laughed at all his poisons and traps, and rested securely among the recesses of the cavernous cliffs, while Joe vainly racked his brain for some method of smoking them out, or of reaching them with dynamite. But they escaped entirely unscathed, and continued their ravages as before. "There's where he lived all last summer," said Joe, pointing to the face of the cliff, "and I couldn't do a thing with him. I was like a fool to him."<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>II<br>&nbsp;<br>This history, gathered so far from the cowboys, I found hard to believe until in the fall of 1893, I made the acquaintance of the wily marauder, and at length came to know him more thoroughly than anyone else. Some years before, in the Bingo days, I had been a wolf-hunter, but my occupations since then had been of another sort, chaining me to stool and desk. I was much in need of a change, and when a friend, who was also a ranch-owner on the Currumpaw, asked me to come to New Mexico and try if I could do anything with this predatory pack, I accepted the invitation and, eager to make the acquaintance of its king, was as soon as possible among the mesas of that region. I spent some time riding about to learn the country, and at intervals, my guide would point to the skeleton of a cow to which the hide still adhered, and remark, "That's some of his work."<br>&nbsp;<br>It became quite clear to me that, in this rough country, it was useless to think of pursuing Lobo with hounds and horses, so that poisons or traps were the only available expedients. At present we had no traps large enough, so I set to work with poison.<br>&nbsp;<br>I need not enter into the details of a hundred devices that I employed to circumvent this 'loup-garou'; there was no combination of strychnine, arsenic, cyanide, or prussic acid, that I did not essay; there was no manner of flesh that I did not try as bait; but morning after morning, as I rode forth to learn the result, I found that all my efforts had been useless. The old king was too cunning for me. A single instance will show his wonderful sagacity. Acting on the hint of an old trapper, I melted some cheese together with the kidney fat of a freshly killed heifer, stewing it in a china dish, and cutting it with a bone knife to avoid the taint of metal. When the mixture was cool, I cut it into lumps, and making a hole in one side of each lump, I inserted a large dose of strychnine and cyanide, contained in a capsule that was impermeable by any odor; finally I sealed the holes up with pieces of the cheese itself. During the whole process, I wore a pair of gloves steeped in the hot blood of the heifer, and even avoided breathing on the baits. When all was ready, I put them in a raw-hide bag rubbed all over with blood, and rode forth dragging the liver and kidneys of the beef at the end of a rope. With this I made a ten-mile circuit, dropping a bait at each quarter of a mile, and taking the utmost care, always, not to touch any with my hands.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lobo, generally, came into this part of the range in the early part of each week, and passed the latter part, it was supposed, around the base of Sierra Grande. This was Monday, and that same evening, as we were about to retire, I heard the deep bass howl of his majesty. On hearing it one of the boys briefly remarked, "There he is, we'll see."<br>&nbsp;<br>The next morning I went forth, eager to know the result. I soon came on the fresh trail of the robbers, with Lobo in the lead &#x2013; his track was always easily distinguished. An ordinary wolf 's forefoot is 4� inches long, that of a large wolf 4� inches, but Lobo's, as measured a number of times, was 5� inches from claw to heel; I afterward found that his other proportions were commensurate, for he stood three feet high at the shoulder, and weighed 150 pounds. His trail, therefore, though obscured by those of his followers, was never difficult to trace. The pack had soon found the track of my drag, and as usual followed it. I could see that Lobo had come to the first bait, sniffed about it, and finally had picked it up.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>Then I could not conceal my delight. "I've got him at last," I exclaimed; "I shall find him stark within a mile," and I galloped on with eager eyes fixed on the great broad track in the dust. It led me to the second bait and that also was gone. How I exulted &#x2013; I surely have him now and perhaps several of his band. But there was the broad paw-mark still on the drag; and though I stood in the stirrup and scanned the plain I saw nothing that looked like a dead wolf. Again I followed &#x2013; to find now that the third bait was gone &#x2013; and the king-wolf 's track led to the fourth, there to learn that he had not really taken a bait at all, but had merely carried them in his mouth. Then having piled the three on the fourth, he scattered filth over them to express his utter contempt for my devices. After this he left my drag and went about his business with the pack he guarded so effectively.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>This is only one of many similar experiences which convinced me that poison would never avail to destroy this robber, and though I contin...</p><h2>Morgan and Mikhail&#39;s Clinical Anesthesiology Flashcards (Lange Flashcards)</h2><p><p><i>Morgan and Mikhail's Anesthesiology Flashcards</i> contain 320 cards that offer a fast, efficient review of high-yield anesthesiology topics.</p> <ul> <li>320 two-sided cards help you review every key topic in clinical anesthesiology </li><li>Great for exam review or as a clinical refresher </li><li>Includes case studies, Q&amp;A, and must-know facts </li><li>Backed by the authority of <i>Morgan &amp; Mikhail's Clinical Anesthesiology</i></li></ul><p></p></p><p><p><b>Richard D.

Drawing on actual business experiences as well as on social science research, Babson College business educator and consultant Mary Gentile challenges the assumptions about business ethics at companies and business schools. She gives business leaders, managers, and students the tools not just to recognize what is right, but also to ensure that the right things happen. The book is inspired by a program Gentile launched at the Aspen Institute with Yale School of Management, and now housed at Babson College, with pilot programs&nbsp;in over one hundred schools and organizations, including INSEAD and MIT Sloan School of Management.</p><p>She explains why past attempts at preparing business leaders to act ethically too often failed, arguing that the issue isn&#x2019;t distinguishing what is right or wrong, but knowing how to act on your values despite opposing pressure. Through research-based advice, practical exercises, and scripts for handling a wide range of ethical dilemmas, Gentile empowers business leaders with the skills to voice and act on their values, and align their professional path with their principles. <i>Giving Voice to Values</i> is an engaging, innovative, and useful guide&nbsp;that is essential reading for anyone in business.</p></p><p><p><b>Mary C.

It is, as Thomas Mann believed, the sole corrective for human history. Without nobility of spirit, culture vanishes. Yet in the early twenty-first century, a time when human dignity and freedom are imperiled, the concept of nobility of spirit is scarcely considered.</p><p>Riemen insists that if we hope to move beyond the war on terror and create a life-affirming culture, we must address timeless but neglected questions: What is a good society? Why art? Why culture? What is the responsibility of intellectuals? Why anti-Americanism? Why nihilism? Why the cult of death of fundamentalists? In a series of three essays, the author identifies nobility of spirit in the life and work of Baruch Spinoza and of Thomas Mann; explores the quest for the good society in our own time; and addresses the pursuit of truth and freedom that engaged figures as disparate as Socrates and Leone Ginzburg, a Jewish Italian intellectual murdered by Nazis.</p><p>&#x201c;The forces now aligned against humanistic values are manifold,&#x201d; observes George Steiner in the foreword to the book. In this imaginative and compelling volume, Riemen addresses these forces and speaks to every reader who believes in the power of classical ideas to restore Western civilization&#x2019;s highest values.</p></p><p><p>Rob Riemen, an essayist and cultural philosopher, is founder of the Nexus Institute, an international center devoted to intellectual reflection and to inspiring Western cultural and philosophical debate.

The book is divided into two parts &#x2014; Part One is devoted to photographs of many of the common textures found in igneous rocks with brief descriptions accompanying each photograph. Part Two illustrates the appearance of examples of some sixty of the commonest (and a few not so common) igneous rock types; each photograph is accompanied by a brief description of the field of view shown. Nearly 300 full-colour photographs are included, and in many cases the same view is shown both in plane-polarized light and under crossed polars. A brief account of how thin sections can be prepared is included as an appendix. It is believed that the amateur geologist using these instructions will be able to make his own thin sections and, with the aid of a relatively simple microscope, enjoy the study of rocks in thin section.W.S.

When asked by a young priest to repeat the sacred ceremonial phrase "to honor and obey," Lupe surprises herself and says. "No, I will not say 'obey'. How dare you! You don't talk to me like this after fifty years of marriage and I now knowing what I know!" After the hilarious shock of Lupe's rejection of the ceremony, the Villase�or family is forced to examine the love that Lupe and Salvador have shared for so many years -- a universal, gut-honest love that will eventually energize and inspire the couple into old age.</p></p><p>A good story, Victor Villase�or writes in the opening pages of this sequel to <i>Rain of Gold</i>, can save your life.<p> Consider, he continues in this memorable portrait of Latino family life, the case of his grandparents, who fled from civil-war-torn Mexico to the United States in 1910. As they traveled north, his father told Villase�or, "Cannons were blasting. People were screaming and dying. The creeks ran red with blood." But Villase�or's grandmother's stories about "the stars, the moon, the she-fox" kept the children's minds off the terrors around them, guiding them to their new homeland and shaping family history. That history provides the grist for Villase�or's exuberantly spinning mill, yielding a sprawling narrative shot through with touches of magical realism and homespun philosophy, and tinged occasionally with regret--as when, for instance, Villase�or's mother confesses, "I miss your father so much ... but I'm the one who could never bring myself to tell him that I loved him."</p><p> But sorrow is rare and humor plentiful as Villase�or affectionately recounts his relatives' travails and improbable dreams, some of which, like a grandfather's quest for gold in a hidden Mexican canyon, come true. As he writes, Villase�or underscores the importance of tradition, faith, forgiveness, and, yes, good stories in making life livable, and this good story will please many readers. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><p>Victor Villase�or vive en California en el rancho donde fue criado.

The narrative follows the explorations of Allan Quatermain, a fortune hunter who travels to Africa in search of ancient treasures and a lost fellow explorer. Written as an adventure story, the novel is also a late-Victorian imperial romance that illuminates the politics of British imperialist capitalism in 1870s and 1880s South Africa. </p> <p> This edition includes contemporary reviews, other writings by Haggard on Africa and romance, and documents focusing on imperialism and diamond mining in late nineteenth-century South Africa. </p></p><p><p> <strong>Gerald Monsman</strong> is a Professor of English at the University of Arizona. He is the author of <em>Olive Schreiner&#x2019;s Fiction: Landscape and Power</em> (1991). </p><p> &#x201c;Scholars, students and general readers will welcome Gerald Monsman&#x2019;s new edition, which comes lavishly supplied with illuminating contextual documents. In a provocative introductory essay, Professor Monsman describes the mythopoeic ambition of <em>King Solomon&#x2019;s Mines</em> by recovering its intellectual context in Victorian anthropology. Haggard sought to create an Africa of the imagination, more precious for the access it gave modern readers to their alienated psychic origins than for its material resources. Readers of this excellent new edition will find that the fictions of imperialism were richer and stranger than they had thought.&#x201d; &#x2015; Ian Duncan, University of California, Berkeley </p></p><h2>Alison&#39;s Zinnia</h2><p><p>Alison acquired an Amaryllis for Beryl.

In the proper Jewish household of her childhood there were several servants. One of them was Anita's beloved nanny, who had taken care of Anita and her younger brother since their birth. Throughout the war, this strong-willed Catholic countrywoman guarded Anita and her brother, passing them off as her own children. For five years they were moved from town to village until they were discovered hiding in a convent and taken to a concentration camp. Somehow they survived until liberation and were brought to Sweden. Eventually Anita's parents were located, and the family was reunited in Stockholm. There Anita went to high school and began taking art lessons. When the family emigrated to New York, Anita won a scholarship to Pratt Institute.<p></p><p>In New York she met and married Arnold Lobel. She became a textile designer, working at home while their two children were growing up. One Christmas she gave Susan Hirschman, then Arnold Lobel's editor, three small scarves that she had made from some of the intricate flowery prints that she specialized in, Susan suggested she do a picture book, and the result was <i>Sven's Bridge</i>. The book was published in 1965 and made the New York Times Best Illustrated Books of the Year list that fall. (It was redesigned in full color and reissued by Greenwillow in 1992.)</p><p>Anita soon discovered that she could combine the exuberance of her decorative fabric designs with the narrative form of picture books. There have been many books over the years, including pictures for texts by various writers; collaborations with Arnold, such as <i>On Market Street</i> and<i> The Rose in My Garden;</i> and her own adaptations from Scandinavian folk stories <i>(King Rooster, Queen Hen; The Pancake; The Straw Maid).</i></p><p>Some of Anita's most challenging favorites have been <i>Princess Furball</i> and <i>Toads and Diamonds </i>by Charlotte Huck; <i>This Quiet Lady</i> by Charlotte Zolotow; and <i>The Cat and the Cook </i>retold by Ethel Heins; as well as her own alphabet books <i>Alison's Zinnia</i> and <i>Away from Home-and The Dwarf Giant,</i> the art for which was inspired by Japanese theater. Her most recent work is her memoir of her childhood in war-torn Poland called <i>No Pretty Pictures: A Child of War.</i></p><p>Anita's interests in theater and music and foreign languages have served her well in her work both as an author and an illustrator. She has also designed clothes, embroidered tapestries, and designed stained glass windows. She has been an actress and a singer. "It is the 'drama' in a picture-book text that interests me the most," she has said. "I 'stage' the story the way a director might work on a theater piece. Even though I have been involved with picture books for many years, with each new text, whether or not I have written it, I am always looking for a new 'vision.' And in the past few years full-color printing techniques have been so improved that I have had a chance to rediscover the way I wanted to paint pictures when I was a young student in art school."</p>"Alison acquired an Amaryllis for Beryl" begins this luscious-looking alphabet book. Linking together a girl's name, a verb, and a flower, the brief text takes readers through 26 varieties and when "Zena zeroed in on a Zinnia for Alison," the chain comes full circle. A generous layout allows the painterly and botanically accurate illustrations to take center stage while a strip at the bottom quarter acts as a storyboard depicting each child's choice of flower. The full-color gouache and watercolor portraits offer a brilliant display of both the familiar, such as the daffodil, and the unfamiliar, like the Urtica. The composition is delightfully varied--one rose stands regally alone while dozens of delicate Quaker-ladies share an entire spread, and the use of color and texture exhibits a masterful touch. One can almost smell the fragrant Sweet william. Some noun and verb combinations seem forced, but most exhibit an inventive use of language that could offer inspiration for further wordplay. An elegant book that might best be enjoyed along with an adult who also appreciates the gift of flowers. --Caroline Ward, Nassau Library System, Uniondale, NY<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Creative Communication: Principles and Applications</h2><p>Learn to perceive multiple possibilities when considering an issue rather than being limited to routine responses!

These conjectures are controlled by criticism: that is, by attempted refutations, which include severely critical tests. They may survive these tests; but they can never be positively justified: they can neither be established as certainly true nor even as 'probable' (in the sense of the probability calculus). Criticism of our conjectures is of decisive importance: by bringing out our mistakes it makes us understand the difficulties of the problems which we try to solve. This is how we become better acquainted with our problem, and able to propose more mature solutions: the very refutation of a theory - that is, of a tentative solution to our problem - is always a step forward that takes us nearer the truth. And this is how we can learn from our mistakes. As we learn from our mistakes our knowledge grows, even though we may never know - that is, know for certain. Since our knowledge can grow, there can be no reason here for despair of reason. And since we can never know for certain, the can be no authority here for any claim to authority, for conceit over our knowledge, or for smugness.<br>The essays and lectures of which this book is composed apply this thesis to many topics, ranging from problems of the philosophy and history of the physical and social sciences to historical and political problems.</p><p><strong>Karl Popper</strong> (1902-1994).

With its easy-to-follow guidance and instructions, The Strip-Built Sea Kayak makes top-notch kayaks accessible to budget-minded paddlers.</p><p><p>Strip-building--assembling a pile of thin wood strips into a functional hull--has been a popular canoe-building method for many years. Now boatbuilder Nick Schade, an engineer by training and a self-professed sea kayaking addict, has refined this time-tested method to build the more complex shapes of sea kayaks. The method is simple, forgiving, allows a liberal amount of design flexibility, and requires a minimum number of tools. It's also relatively inexpensive: about $500 to $600 for one of the designs discussed here--one-quarter the price of a factory-built model. In <i>The Strip-Built Sea Kayak</i>, Schade presents full plans for three elegant designs inspired by the grace and seaworthiness of the Inuit and Aleut skin boats.

As the collective influence of corporations has grown, governments around the world have stepped back from their responsibility to protect public health by privatizing key services, weakening regulations, and cutting funding for consumer and environmental protection. Today's corporations are increasingly free to make decisions that benefit their bottom line at the expense of public health. <br><br><em>Lethal but Legal </em>examines how corporations have impacted -- and plagued -- public health over the last century, first in industrialized countries and now in developing regions. It is both a current history of corporations' antagonism towards health and an analysis of the emerging movements that are challenging these industries' dangerous practices. The reforms outlined here aim to strike a healthier balance between large companies' right to make a profit and governments' responsibility to protect their populations. <br><br>While other books have addressed parts of this story, <em>Lethal but Legal</em> is the first to connect the dots between unhealthy products, business-dominated politics, and the growing burdens of disease and health care costs. By identifying the common causes of all these problems, then situating them in the context of other health challenges that societies have overcome in the past, this book provides readers with the insights they need to take practical and effective action to restore consumers' right to health.<br></p><p><br><strong>Nicholas Freudenberg, PhD, MPH, </strong>is Distinguished Professor of Public Health at the City University of New York School of Public Health at Hunter College and founder and director of Corporations and Health Watch (www.corporationsandhealth.org), an international network of activists and researchers that monitors the business practices of the alcohol, automobile, firearms, food and beverage, pharmaceutical, and tobacco industries.<br>In a nutshell, public-health professor Freudenberg finds that the greatest threat to the health and well-being of humanity is an upside-down health system. He contends that, rather than a political-economic system that supports the health of the general population, public health is compromised to support the well-being of our current political-economic system. He refers to what he calls a &#x201c;corporate consumption complex,&#x201d; a disproportionately small group of business and political interests, as if it is an entity that thrives on &#x201c;hyperconsumption&#x201d; by a mass populace whose good health is being sacrificed in the name of profit. He makes his case via examples of both blatant and unintentional disregard for public health within the food, alcohol, tobacco, pharmaceutical, gun, and automobile industries, which value profit over consumer health. His argument is so strong, passionate, and laced with intemperate phrases that it is clear that Freudenberg&#x2019;s intention is less a call to reason than a rallying cry for an army of Davids against a systemic Goliath. --Donna Chavez</p><h2>Implementing the Lexical Approach: Putting Theory into Practice</h2><p>IMPLEMENTING THE LEXICAL APPROACH describes how the lexical approach works in the classroom.

As the Cold War reached Thailand, America had a choice: Should it, as Thompson believed, help other nations build democracies from their traditional cultures or, as his ex-OSS friend Willis Bird argued, remake the world through deception and self-serving alliances? In a story rich with insights and intrigue, this book explores a key Cold War episode that is still playing out today.</p><ul><li>Highlights a pivotal moment in Cold War history that set a course for American foreign policy that is still being followed today</li><li>Explores the dynamics that put Thailand at the center of the Cold War and the fighting in neighboring Laos that escalated from sideshow to the largest covert operation America had ever engaged in</li><li>Draws on personal recollections and includes atmospheric details that bring the people, events&#x2014;and the Thailand of the time&#x2014;to life</li><li>Written by a journalist with extensive experience in Asian affairs who has spent years investigating every aspect of this story, including Thompson's tragic disappearance</li></ul></p><p>In the 1950s, U.S. foreign policy makers and intelligence agencies faced a momentous choice: Should America, as former OSS officer Jim Thompson believed, fight the Cold War by helping other nations build democratic, capitalistic futures while preserving and strengthening their traditional cultures? Or would it be more practical, as Thompson's old OSS buddy Bill Bird argued, to help local strongmen seize power and prop them up with financial and military aid in return for their staunch anticommunism and the establishment of American military bases on their soil? History makes two things perfectly clear&#x2014;America chose the latter course, and anyone who disagreed with that choice, including Jim Thompson, was in serious danger.<p>In <i>The Ideal Man</i>, journalist and Southeast Asia expert Joshua Kurlantzick tells the compelling and tragic story of an OSS officer posted to Thailand in 1945 who fell in love with that then-remote nation and made it his home. Through this powerful lens, Kurlantzick offers insight into a pivotal moment in Cold War history that set a course for American foreign policy that is still being followed today.</p><p>Kurlantzick reveals that, as a civilian, Thompson epitomized all that was best about postwar America. This former society dilettante quickly discovered the disappearing Thai cottage industry of silk farming and weaving and rebuilt it into a vast new source of wealth for the nation and thousands of its workers. But Jim Thompson was leading a double life.</p><p>Thanks to his growing business, his passion for his new home, and his innate curiosity, Thompson had access to people and places that no other American could equal. He quickly became the go-to man for agents of the newly formed CIA. But he made no secret of his support for nationalist fighters in Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, or his opposition to America's increasing military presence and support of Thai generals. Soon, he and Bill Bird found themselves on opposite sides in coups, congressional investigations, and what was, at the time, America's largest-ever covert operation.</p><p>Thompson's very public opposition to what had become established American policy earned him plenty of enemies, especially among Thai generals. His disappearance in 1967 became an international mystery that has fostered decades of speculation.</p><p>Bristling with thorny insider tales of OSS and CIA exploits, political gamesmanship, and international intrigue, <i>The Ideal Man</i> is ideal reading for anyone who loves history, spy stories, and behind-the-scenes accounts of how diplomatic policy decisions are made&#x2014;for better or worse.</p><b>Praise for <i>The Ideal Man</i></b><p>"Joshua Kurlantzick has written a sad, evocative tale of an American voyager who conquers a strange land only to be lost in it, caught between cultures and his own demons. <i>The Ideal Man</i> will appeal to readers of Graham Greene and The Ugly American, but it's also a timeless story of innocence and knowing too much."<br>&#x2014;<b>Evan Thomas, author of <i>Sea of Thunder</i> and <i>The War Lovers</i></b></p><p>"Here is a more troubled and troubling Jim Thompson than we have previously encountered: the silk king enters the heart of darkness.

Doesn't cultural clumsiness undercut military power every time? Kurlantzick's glamorous protagonist, the 'silk king' Jim Thompson, saw American anticommunism wreak such havoc in Southeast Asia that it helped give rise to a later communist victory. This fascinating book will leave you wondering how often this pattern is going to be repeated, on large and small scales, in the Middle East, Afghanistan, and beyond."<br>&#x2014;<b>Roger Warner, author of <i>Shooting at the Moon: The Story of America's Clandestine War in Laos</i></b></p></p><h2>Grand Opera: The Story of the Met</h2><p>The Metropolitan has stood among the grandest of opera companies since its birth in 1883. Tracing the offstage/onstage workings of this famed New York institution, Charles Affron and Mirella Jona Affron tell how the Met became and remains a powerful actor on the global cultural scene. In this first new history of the company in thirty years, each of the chronologically sequenced chapters surveys a composer or a slice of the repertoire and brings to life dominant personalities and memorable performances of the time. From the opening night <i>Faust</i> to the recent controversial production of Wagner&#x2019;s &#x201c;Ring,&#x201d; <i>Grand Opera</i> is a remarkable account of management and audience response to the push and pull of tradition and reinvention. Spanning the decades between the Gilded Age and the age of new media, this story of the Met concludes by tipping its hat to the hugely successful &#x201c;Live in HD&#x201d; simulcasts and other twenty-first-century innovations. <i>Grand Opera</i>&#x2019;s appeal extends far beyond the large circle of opera enthusiasts. Drawing on unpublished documents from the Metropolitan Opera Archives, reviews, recordings, and much more, this richly detailed book looks at the Met in the broad context of national and international issues and events.</p><p>"Drawing on vast and intricate research, <i>Grand Opera</i> lays out the entire history of the Metropolitan Opera&#x2015;its triumphs and its catastrophes, its labor squabbles and its architecture, its impresarios and its stars.

This isn't a psychoanalytic take on meditation but a roll-up-your-sleeves and get-down-to-basics examination of the average meditator's experiences of training the mind in meditation. Nairn, who began practicing meditation in 1964 in India, and who has attended and led numerous meditation retreats, describes the mental processes that a meditator goes through, the obstacles the meditator encounters, and the practices that lead to advancement--all in the most unencumbered language. In addition to his descriptions, Nairn offers Q&amp;A sessions from a retreat, specific practices with clear, step-by-step instructions and the reasons for doing them, and a guide for group meditation leaders that elucidates practices and anticipates difficulties surrounding them. In other words, here is an experienced friend to turn to when working with that bug-prone computer in your head. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Rob Nairn's training in psychology and Buddhist practice brings him a unique ability to explain ancient Eastern concepts in modern, accessible terms.

Although Adam Smith amply confirmed this more than two hundred years ago in his analysis of sharecropping contracts, only in recent decades has a theory begun to emerge to place the topic at the heart of economic thinking. In this book, Jean-Jacques Laffont and David Martimort present the most thorough yet accessible introduction to incentives theory to date. Central to this theory is a simple question as pivotal to modern-day management as it is to economics research: What makes people act in a particular way in an economic or business situation? In seeking an answer, the authors provide the methodological tools to design institutions that can ensure good incentives for economic agents.</p><br><p> This book focuses on the principal-agent model, the "simple" situation where a principal, or company, delegates a task to a single agent through a contract--the essence of management and contract theory. How does the owner or manager of a firm align the objectives of its various members to maximize profits? Following a brief historical overview showing how the problem of incentives has come to the fore in the past two centuries, the authors devote the bulk of their work to exploring principal-agent models and various extensions thereof in light of three types of information problems: adverse selection, moral hazard, and non-verifiability. Offering an unprecedented look at a subject vital to industrial organization, labor economics, and behavioral economics, this book is set to become the definitive resource for students, researchers, and others who might find themselves pondering what contracts, and the incentives they embody, are really all about.</p></p><p><p>"Incentive theory is at the very core of economics.

Guerard, Ian Watt, Fredric Jameson, J. Hillis Miller, Edward Said, Philip M. Weinstein, Paul B. Armstrong, Marianne DeKoven, and Daphana Erdinast-Vulcan.</p><p>When <i>Lord Jim</i> first appeared in 1900, many took Joseph Conrad to task for couching an entire novel in the form of an extended conversation--a ripping good yarn, if you like. (One critic in <i>The Academy</i> complained that the narrator "was telling that after-dinner story to his companions for eleven solid hours.") Conrad defended his method, insisting that people really do talk for that long, and listen as well. In fact his chatty masterwork requires no defense--it offers up not only linguistic pleasures but a timeless exploration of morality.<p> The eponymous Jim is a young, good-looking, genial, and naive water-clerk on the <i>Patna</i>, a cargo ship plying Asian waters. He is, we are told, "the kind of fellow you would, on the strength of his looks, leave in charge of the deck." He also harbors romantic fantasies of adventure and heroism--which are promptly scuttled one night when the ship collides with an obstacle and begins to sink. Acting on impulse, Jim jumps overboard and lands in a lifeboat, which happens to be bearing the unscrupulous captain and his cohorts away from the disaster. The <i>Patna</i>, however, manages to stay afloat. The foundering vessel is towed into port--and since the officers have strategically vanished, Jim is left to stand trial for abandoning the ship and its 800 passengers. </p><p> Stripped of his seaman's license, convinced of his own cowardice, Jim sets out on a tragic and transcendent search for redemption. This may sound like the bleakest of narratives. But <i>Lord Jim</i> is also touching, elevating, and often funny. Here, for example, the narrator describes the ship's captain (proving that clothes do indeed make the man): </p><blockquote> He made me think of a trained baby elephant walking on hind-legs. He was extravagantly gorgeous too--got up in a soiled sleeping suit, bright green and deep orange vertical stripes, with a pair of ragged straw slippers on his bare feet, and somebody's cast-off pith hat, very dirty and two sizes too small for him, tied up with a manilla rope-yarn on the top of his big head. You understand a man like that hasn't a ghost of a chance when it comes to borrowing clothes. </blockquote> This is formidable prose by any standard. But when you consider that Conrad was working in his third language, the sublime after-dinner story that is <i>Lord Jim</i> seems even more astonishing an accomplishment. <i>--Teri Kieffer</i>This book is in Electronic Paperback Format.

She thinks she sees through everyone and rules over a family of dependents with knowing cynicism. But there are two people in Redborough who resist her. One is Hester, a young relation with a personality as strong as Catherine's, and as determined to find a role for herself. The other is Edward, who Catherine treats like a son. Conflict between the young and the old is inevitable, and in its depiction of the complex relationships that develop between the three principal characters, <em>Hester</em> is a masterpiece of psychological realism. In exploring the difficulty of understanding human nature, it is also a compulsive story of financial and sexual risk-taking that inevitably results in a searing climax.

Combining a bibliographic study with an inquiry into method, it opens with a survey of the principal reference tools available to historians of Islam and a systematic review of the sources they will confront. Problems of method are then examined in a series of chapters, each exploring a broad topic in the social and political history of the Middle East and North Africa between A.D. 600 and 1500. The topics selected represent a cross-section of Islamic historical studies, and range from the struggles for power within the early Islamic community to the life of the peasantry. Each chapter pursues four questions. What concrete research problems are likely to be most challenging and productive? What resources do we possess for dealing with these problems? What strategies can we devise to exploit our resources most effectively? What is the current state of the scholarly literature for the topic under study?</p></p><p><p>"This book is an extremely judicious `stock-taking' of scholarship in the field of medieval Islamic history, especially valuable for the way it examines--and forces us to reconsider--the assumptions on which previous scholarship has been based.... Students of Islamic studies will find it indispensable."--<b>Fred M.

Following the criminalization of their religion by Elizabeth I, nearly two hundred Catholics were executed, and many more wasted away in prison during her reign. Torture was used more than at any other time in England's history. While some bowed to the pressure of the government and new church, publicly conforming to acts of Protestant worship, others did not - and quickly found themselves living in a state of siege. Under constant surveillance, haunted by the threat of imprisonment - or worse - the ordinary lives of these so-called recusants became marked by evasion, subterfuge, and constant fear.<br><br>In<em> God's Traitors</em>, Jessie Childs tells the fascinating story of one Catholic family, the Vauxes of Harrowden Hall, from the foundation of the Church of England in the 1530s to the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, and their struggle to keep the faith in Protestant England. Few Elizabethans would have disputed that obedience was a Christian duty, but following the excommunication of Queen Elizabeth by Pope Pius V in 1570 and the growing anti-Catholic sentiment in the decades that followed, it became increasingly difficult for English Catholics to maintain a dual allegiance to their God and their Queen. Childs follows the Vauxes into the heart of the underground Catholic movement, exploring the conflicts of loyalty they faced and the means by which they exerted defiance. Tracing the family's path from staunch loyalty to the Crown, to passive resistance and on to increasing activism, Childs illustrates the pressures and painful choices that confronted the persecuted Catholic community. Though recusants like the Vauxes comprised only a tiny fraction of the Catholic minority in England, they aroused fears in the heart of the commonwealth. Childs shows how "anti-popery" became an ideology and a cultural force, shaping not only the life and policy of Elizabeth I, but also those of her successors. <br><br>From clandestine chapels and side-street inns to exile communities and the corridors of power, <em>God's Traitors</em> exposes the tensions and insecurities that plagued Catholics living under the rule of Elizabeth I. Above all, it is a timely story of courage and concession, repression and reaction, and the often terrible consequences when religion and politics collide.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jessie Childs</strong> is an author and historian.

Tour.</p><p>The marvelous second chapter of <i>Farewell</i> sets the mood for everything to come in the noted playwright's memoir of his childhood in tiny Wharton, Texas. As a young Horton Foote questions his parents about their "elopement"--they had to go five blocks across town to be wed by a Baptist minister because his mother's Methodist parents didn't approve of the match--the intricate web of kinship, friendship, and local geography that shapes small-town life is hilariously yet touchingly revealed in each of their asides and elaborations. Foote's birth in 1916 healed the family rift, and he grew up in a cozy environment where everyone knew everyone else and more or less accepted their eccentricities. He doesn't gloss over the harsh realities of racial prejudice and segregation, but his tone is nonetheless elegiac, glowing with the magic of the characters' storytelling. Southerners have always been famous for their ability to spin yarns, and Foote captures that in extended passages of conversation. Direct quotes are generally cause for suspicion in a memoir, but when the dialogue has the same vigor and subtlety found in the author's screenplays and plays (<i>A Trip to Bountiful</i> and <i>The Young Man from Atlanta</i> among them), you're willing to give Foote the benefit of the doubt. <i>--Wendy Smith</i><b>Horton Foote</b> has written and adapted dozens of plays and screenplays, including <i>The Trip to Bountiful, The Orphans' Home Cycle, The Young Man from Atlanta, Tender Mercies,</i> and <i>To Kill a Mockingbird. The Death of Papa</i> is being staged at the Hartford Theater in the spring of 1999. Foote has won Academy and Writers Guild awards, as well as the Pulitzer Prize. He recently was honored for his body of work at the Telluride Film Festival, and received the Writers Guild's Ian McLellan Hunter Award for lifetime achievement in writing. In 1996 he was elected to the Theatre Hall of Fame, and in 1998, to the American Academy of Arts and Letters as a member in the Department of Literature. He also received the Academy's Gold Medal for Drama for his life's work.</p><h2>The Complete Australian Cattle Dog</h2><p>The Australian Cattle Dog was developed as a breed by stockmen who wanted a tough, working dog who could drive cattle in the harsh environment of the Australian outback. A number of different dogs were used to produce the ideal type, and these included the native Dingo, the Collie, imported from Britain, and the Australian Kelpie. The authors trace the origins of this tough, intelligent working dog from the Australian outback to the first imports to reach North America, Britain and the rest of Europe. All aspects of caring for the Australian Cattle Dog are covered, such as feeding, exercise, breeding and rearing, and there is a special section on the principles of training and the working role of the Australian Cattle Dog.</p><p>Professional dog trainers John and Mary Holmes first came across the Australian Cattle Dog in 1979 when they were on a tour of Australia, giving talks to training classes. John, who has always had a special interest in farm working dogs, was determined to bring the breed to Britain, and in 1980 they imported Aust. Ch. Landmaster Darling Red. The following year they took her to Crufts &#x2014; the first ACD to be seen there &#x2014; and she was well placed in "Any Variety Not Separately Classified." In 1986 her son and daughter won the AVNSC category. Both John and Mary have worked tirelessly to get the Australian Cattle Dog established outside its native home, and the newsletter, which Mary edited for eight years has done much to promote the breed. They were founder members of the ACD Society in Britain; John was the first Chairman and is now President of the Society. Judging appointments for the breed include the Jackpot Classes at the ACDACA Specialty in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and the Crufts Centenary show. John and Mary are well known for their film and television work, training a variety of different animals. John is also a bestselling author with two of his books, The Family Dog and The Farmer's Dog, both in their twelfth editions.</p><h2>Research Methods in Criminal Justice and Criminology</h2><p><p> <i>For courses in Research Methods in Criminal Justice and Criminology</i> </p> <p> </p> <p> <br> </p> <p> <b>Teaches research fundamentals with a grounded, real-world approach</b> <br> <b> <i>Research Methods in Criminal Justice and Criminology</i>, Tenth Edition</b>, teaches contemporary research methods using examples of real criminological and criminal justice studies to illustrate concepts and techniques.

With <i>In Search of the Trojan War</i>, Michael Wood brings vividly to life the legend and lore of the Heroic Age in an archaeological adventure that sifts through the myths and speculation to provide a fresh view of the riches and the reality of ancient Troy.<br><br>This gripping story shows why the legend of Troy forms the bedrock of Western culture and why its past is a paradigm of human history. Wood's meticulous scholarly sleuthing yields fascinating evidence about the continuity and development of human civilization in the Aegean and Asia Minor. With its 50 feet of debris resulting from constant rebuilding, human destruction, earthquake, and abandonment, the mound of Troy contains the beginnings and ends of new races and civilizations.<br><br>This edition includes a new preface, a new final chapter, and an addendum to the bibliography that take account of dramatic new developments in the search for Troy with the rediscovery, in Moscow, of the so-called Jewels of Helen and the re-excavation of the site of Troy, which began in 1988 and is yielding new evidence about the historical city.</p><p><b>Michael Wood</b> is a writer and historian living in England. He is the author of several highly acclaimed books including <i>In Search of the Trojan War</i> (California, 1989).In this liberally illustrated volume written to accompany a forthcoming PBS series, BBC producer and series narrator Wood, author of In Search of the Dark Ages, etc., explores the origins of Homer's epics and efforts of archeologists to document the historic truth of the Bronze Age Trojan War as celebrated in the Iliad. Oral tradition and accounts by poets, he notes, have yet to be disproved by archeology. He cites the fascination which the Trojan story has exercised throughout history and on travelers of all periodsByron among them. Despite archeologist Heinrich Schliemann's exaggerations, the author credits him with the development of modern archeology into a science. Schliemann's finds and those of other archeologists of Mycenaean, Minoan and Hittite civilizations are discussed in some detail. Troy, Wood speculates, may have been one of many cties sacked by the Greeks for economic reasons, and Helen one of the many women captured. 50,000 first printing; History Book Club main selection; BOMC and Macmillan's Natural Science alternates.<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Luckey&#39;s Hummel Figurines and Plates: Identification and Price Guide (12th Edition)</h2><p>Expert Hummel historian Dean Genth updates, expands, and enhances this eagerly anticipated new edition of a comprehensive volume for Hummel collectors, enthusiasts and dealers. <p>This officially licensed book features nearly 3,000 figurines, prints, plates, postcards, calendars, and more.

Barnes &amp; Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences&#x2014;biographical, historical, and literary&#x2014;to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.<br><br> When it first appeared in 1899, Kate Chopin&#x2019;s <i>The Awakening</i> was greeted with cries of outrage. The novel&#x2019;s frank portrayal of a woman&#x2019;s emotional, intellectual, and sexual awakening shocked the sensibilities of the time and destroyed the author&#x2019;s reputation and career. Many years passed before this short, pioneering work was recognized as a major achievement in American literature.<br><br> Set in and around New Orleans, <i>The Awakening</i> tells the story of Edna Pontellier, a young wife and mother who, determined to control her own life, flouts convention by moving out of her husband&#x2019;s house, having an adulterous affair, and becoming an artist.<br><br> Beautifully written, with sensuous imagery and vivid local descriptions, <i>The Awakening</i> has lost none of its power to provoke and inspire. Additionally, this edition includes thirteen of Kate Chopin&#x2019;s magnificent short stories.<br><br> Stories Included in the Volume:<br><i>The Awakening<br> Emancipation: A Life Fable<br> A Shameful Affair<br> At the &#x2018;Cadian Ball<br> D�sir�e&#x2019;s Baby<br> A Gentleman of Bayou T�che<br> A Respectable Woman<br> The Story of an Hour<br> Ath�na�se<br> A Pair of Silk Stockings<br> Elizabeth Stock&#x2019;s One Story<br> The Storm<br> The Godmother<br> A Little Country Girl</i>&nbsp;</p><p>Rachel Adams teaches nineteenth and twentieth-century American literature at Columbia University.<b>From Rachel Adams's Introduction to <i>The Awakening and Selected Short Fiction</i></b> <p>Chopin may have begun her serious efforts as a writer out of grief. As a young widow, she contended with the provincialism of Cloutierville for two more years before returning to St. Louis to live with her mother, Eliza. When Eliza died of cancer just one year later, Chopin was heartbroken. But she also began to participate in the intellectual life of the city and to make serious efforts to establish herself as a professional author. Although she moved in literary circles, she resisted alliance with any particular group. A brief membership in the Wednesday Club, a select coterie of women intellectuals who gathered for conversation and debate, only strengthened her distaste for such organized activities. More than once, her fiction depicts women reformers or intellectuals in unflattering terms. Concerned about his wife's erratic behavior in <i>The Awakening</i>, L�once consults the family doctor, who asks him if she has "been associating of late with a circle of pseudo-intellectual women-super-spiritual superior beings." These words drip with a disdain that is unrelieved by authorial commentary. Struggling to find venues for her work, Chopin wrote regularly and kept careful records of submissions and rejections. At first, she was most successful with regional publications, placing her poem "<i>If It Might Be</i>" in a Chicago magazine called <i>America</i> and short stories in the <i>Philadelphia Music Journal</i> and <i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i>. It proved more difficult to access national periodicals like <i>The Atlantic Monthly, Harper's</i>, and <i>Century</i>. At a time when the social conservatism of the Victorian era still prevailed, Chopin's treatment of such controversial topics as extramarital affairs, venereal disease, murder, and miscegenation often made her work unpalatable to the major literary magazines. Eventually she would break into this market by publishing stories in nationally circulating periodicals such as <i>Vogue, Century</i>, and <i>Youth's Companion</i>. </p><p>Among Chopin's literary influences was the French writer Guy de Maupassant, whose realism and formal sophistication she admired. Her respect for his frank treatment of taboo subjects inspired her to translate a number of his stories, but their controversial nature made publication difficult. A more conventional early model was the eminent realist author and magazine editor William Dean Howells, who sent her a brief note of praise for her short story "<i>Boulot and Boulotte</i>." For the depiction of strong, independent female characters, Chopin looked to Sarah Orne Jewett and Mary Wilkins Freeman. She has frequently been grouped with these women as a writer of local color fiction, a genre unjustly dismissed by several generations of critics. More recently, scholars have seen her use of local color techniques as a strategy to gain a foothold in the literary marketplace and to stake a claim in contemporary debates about gender, race, and region. From this perspective, her short story "<i>A Gentleman of Bayou T�che</i>," in which an artist from the city attempts to exploit a humble fisherman for his "local color," reads like an allegory for the regional writer's confrontation with the literary establishment. Reviewers of Chopin's first collection, <i>Bayou Folk</i> (1894), failed to notice such instances of understated social commentary. While generally positive, contemporary responses hailed her depiction of charming local details, rather than her treatment of social issues. Reviewers found a more complicated outlook and maturity of authorial voice in her second collection, A Night in Acadie (1897). An essay in the <i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i> praising Chopin's artistry and psychological insight urged readers to think beyond the associations with local color, to recognize "gifts . . . that go deeper than mere patois and local description." A second review demurred, describing Chopin as a specialist in the "childlike southern people who are the subject of her brief romances" and expressing regret that some of the stories were "marred by one or two slight and unnecessary coarseness [sic]." </p><p>Despite considerable appreciation by her contemporaries, Chopin would have remained neglected by literary history if it were not for the recovery of <i>The Awakening</i> in the 1960s. Its renewed popularity also brought attention to the whole corpus of her work, which includes numerous poems, essays, and short stories, as well as her first novel, <i>At Fault</i>. These texts illuminate many of the concerns of <i>The Awakening</i> but are also of considerable interest in their own right. Read in its entirety, Chopin's fiction introduces a broad swath of personalities, from impoverished blacks and Acadians of the Bayou to plantation elites and urban intellectuals. Whereas some stories turn seemingly trivial events-the shopping spree of an abstemious middle-aged woman, a country girl's visit to the circus-into dramatic interior conflicts, others deal with more overtly controversial issues such as miscegenation, venereal disease, murder, and extramarital sex. The relatively circumscribed geographical parameters of Chopin's fiction extend from lively, cosmopolitan New Orleans to the insular, rural byways of nineteenth-century Louisiana. Unlike the minutely detailed, inclusive catalogues of realist fiction, her preference is for the sketch, which conveys an impression rather than a sharply delineated picture. Frequently, Chopin writes as an insider whose intimacy with her subjects is conveyed through the use of local dialect and allusions. As a result, whereas the human dramas are readily accessible, contemporary readers may struggle to gain a precise understanding of character and locale.</p></p><h2>The Fear of Freedom (Routledge Classics)</h2><p>Erich Fromm sees right to the heart of our contradictory needs for community and for freedom like no other writer before or since. In <em>Fear of Freedom</em>, Fromm warns that the price of community is indeed high, and it is the individual who pays. Fascism and authoritarianism may seem like receding shadows for some, but are cruel realities for many. Erich Fromm leaves a valuable and original legacy to his readers - a vastly increased understanding of the human character in relation to society. At the beginning of the 21st century, it is more important than ever to be aware of his powerful message.

Showcasing works from all of his major series, the book surveys the full sweep of Stella&#x2019;s career, from his artistic beginnings in high school and college to today.<br> &nbsp;<br> The book&#x2019;s spectacular plate section comprises more than 100 works, including paintings, sculptures, reliefs, and works on paper.

Essays discuss topics such as the artist&#x2019;s early years at Phillips Academy in Andover and Princeton University, and his late-career architectural pieces created with the aid of computer software. An interview with Stella conducted by American painter Laura Owens allows Stella to illuminate his artistic practice in his own words. Additional resources include a chronology with extensive bibliographic and exhibition references. This definitive publication is the most thorough examination to date of Stella&#x2019;s astounding contributions in all media, which cement his role as one of the most important practitioners of modern abstraction.&nbsp;</p><p>This comprehensive look at one of America&#x2019;s most influential abstract artists includes his seminal <i>Black Paintings</i>, recent high-relief aluminum works, a previously unpublished group of drawings, and a fascinating interview with Stella himself.<br><b>Michael Auping</b> is chief curator at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, Texas.&nbsp;<b>Jordan Kantor</b> is an artist based in San Francisco. <b>Adam D.

Adapted from a best-selling novel by Davis Grubb, it is part expressionist horror movie, part luminous fairytale, and contains some of the most haunting images in cinema: Willa (Shelley Winters), her throat cut and hair streaming out like seaweed, sitting in a submerged Model T Ford; her children, framed by looming animals, in a downriver flight from Preacher (Robert Mitchum), a silhouetted threat on the horizon. &#34;The Night of the Hunter&#34; is revered today, but it failed on its first release, and Laughton never recovered from the disappointment. Simon Callow explores Laughton&#39;s transition between film actor and director, and examines the considerable influence the film has had on subsequent filmmakers such as Neil Jordan and even Callow himself.<p>In addition to his distinguished career in the theater, <b>Simon Callow</b> has appeared in the films <i>Amadeus</i>, <i>A Room with A View</i>, and <i>Four Weddings and a Funeral</i>.

The Edenists are genetically engineered space-dwellers with a telepathic affinity to their homes and ships. The Adamists reject advanced technology, but are willing to pioneer new worlds. Under the watchful eye of mysterious aliens, humanity must confront its most bitter enemy--itself.</p><p>This second volume of Hamilton's two-part book <i>The Reality Dysfunction</i> is as fast paced and densely packed as the first. It picks up the many plot threads left hanging in <i>Emergence</i>and runs with them, ending some subplots and beginning other more interesting ones. Joining the large cast of characters is Graeme Nicholson, a reporter stuck on the backwater planet of Lalonde, where mud and wood seem to be the only things in great abundance. But Lalonde is fast becoming the focus of an invasion that seems to defy time and logic, and soon Nicholson will regret ever learning about the biggest story to hit the galaxy in a thousand years.Peter F.

This third edition has been substantially revised and rewritten, with new material covering the latest developments in architectural and construction technologies, digital methodologies, new areas of focus in teaching and practice, evolving aesthetic philosophies, sustainability and green architecture, and alternatives to traditional practice. </p><p><i>Architect?</i> tells the inside story of architectural education and practice; it is realistic, unvarnished, and insightful. Chapter 1 asks &#x201c;Why Be an Architect?&#x201d; and chapter 2 offers reasons &#x201c;Why Not to Be an Architect.&#x201d; After this provocative beginning, Architect? goes on to explain and critique architectural education, covering admission, degree and curriculum types, and workload as well as such post-degree options as internship, teaching, and work in related fields. It offers a detailed discussion of professors and practitioners and the &#x201c;-isms&#x201d; and &#x201c;-ologies&#x201d; most prevalent in teaching and practicing architecture. It explains how an architect works and gets work, and describes architectural services from initial client contact to construction oversight. The new edition also includes a generous selection of drawings and cartoons from the author's Washington Post column, &#x201c;Shaping the City,&#x201d; offering teachable moments wittily in graphic form.</p><p>The author, Roger Lewis, has taught, practiced, and written extensively about architecture for many years. In <i>Architect?</i> he explains&#x2015;for students, professors, practitioners, and even prospective clients&#x2015;how architects think and work and what they care about as they strive to make the built environment more commodious, more beautiful, and more sustainable.</p></p><p>This book about becoming and being an architect seems to be missing in the literature of architecture, a literature otherwise rich and plentiful. There are thousands of books on architectural monuments, movements, history, theory, design, drawing, technology, and management. They contain useful checklists and standardized documents but reveal none of the agonies and ecstacies of being and architect.Roger K.

With this new book, students, researchers, and practitioners now have a go-to reference on efficacy research packed with psychological strategies for helping athletes, teams, and coaches overcome specific weaknesses. <i>Self-Efficacy in Sport</i>&#x2014;the first book devoted entirely to this important topic&#x2014;compiles over 30 years of burgeoning self-efficacy research into a comprehensive and up-to-date analysis. </p><p><i>Self-Efficacy in Sport</i> is written by Dr. Deborah Feltz, who has spent more than 30 years researching the relationship between efficacy and performance in sport. The book is coauthored by two of Feltz's prominent former students who have established research careers in their own right. The book introduces theory-based and research-tested guidelines and recommendations for designing, implementing, and evaluating interventions to improve self-efficacy, yet it remains easy for readers to find research and interventions that fit their needs. An annotated bibliography allows readers to quickly and critically evaluate all the self-efficacy research cited in the book, which prevents this text from becoming simply a long literature review. Practitioners will be able to put research into practice to serve clients, and students and researchers will be challenged to think critically about the subject and chart the course for new directions in research.</p><p>The clearly organized reference breaks down self-efficacy research and implementation into three key areas: individual athletes, teams, and coaches. <b>Part I</b> examines the conceptual nature of efficacy beliefs and their place in sport psychology. <b>Part II</b> explains what is known about self-efficacy, collective efficacy, and coaching efficacy&#x2014;and why they are vital in sport. <b>Part III</b> translates research into strategy by offering practical advice for efficacy interventions, and it summarizes current critical issues and focuses on future directions. </p><p><i>Self-Efficacy in Sport</i> contains the following unique features that will engage readers in the material: </p><p>-Chapter summaries tie content together and reinforce the real-world application of concepts.</p><p>-A comprehensive annotated bibliography of influential research studies guides readers in further study and provides a background for important research.</p><p>-A chapter on future directions of study ensures readers are up to date on established topics and emerging trends.<br><i>Self-Efficacy in Sport</i> is a must-have reference for researchers as well as students and instructors in this evolving area. Practitioners will be able to use the information, especially the direct applications, to discover research that translates into strategy. <br></p></p><p><p><b>Deborah Feltz, PhD,</b> is professor and chairperson of the department of kinesiology at Michigan State University in East Lansing.

It is uniquely broad in scope, offering a masterful overview of the foundation, research, and application of self-efficacy theory in the field of athletics. Because of the scope and depth of coverage, this book is an invaluable resource for theorists and practitioners alike seeking an understanding of how beliefs of personal and collective efficacy contribute to the quality of athletic life. But it is about more than sports. The insights it provides can also serve one well in other life pursuits. This is a truly outstanding book that has the makings of a classic in the field of athletics.""<br>Albert Bandura</p><h2>Elements of Literature - Fifth Course: North Carolina Edition (Holt Elements of Literature)</h2><p>Holt Elements of Literature North Carolina: Student Edition Grade 11 2005 [Jan 01, 2005] HOLT, RINEHART AND WINSTON</p><p></p><h2>Algebra and Trigonometry Enhanced with Graphing Utilities, Books a la Carte Edition Plus NEW MyLab Math -- 24-Month Access Card Package</h2><p><p> <b>NOTE:</b> This edition features the same content as the traditional text in a convenient, three-hole-punched, loose-leaf version.

Craig's death in 1978, Bob Hogg has revised the later editions of this text. However, when Prentice Hall asked him to consider a sixth edition, he thought of his good friend, Joe McKean, and asked him to help. That was a great choice for Joe made many excellent suggestions on which we both could agree and these changes are outlined later in this preface. </p> <p> In addition to Joe's ideas, our colleague Jon Cryer gave us his marked up copy of the fifth edition from which we changed a number of items. Moreover, George Woodworth and Kate Cowles made a number of suggestions concerning the new Bayesian chapter; in particular, Woodworth taught us about a "Dutch book" used in many Bayesian proofs. Of course, in addition to these three, we must thank others, both faculty and students, who have made worthwhile suggestions. However, our greatest debts of gratitude are for our special friend, Tom Hettmansperger of Penn State University, who used our revised notes in his mathematical statistics course during the 2002-2004 academic years and Suzanne Dubnicka of Kansas State University who used our notes in her mathematical statistics course during Fall of 2003. From these experiences, Tom and Suzanne and several of their students provided us with new ideas and corrections. </p> <p> While in earlier editions, Hogg and Craig had resisted adding any "real" problems, Joe did insert a few among his more important changes. While the level of the book is aimed for beginning graduate students in Statistics, it is also suitable for senior undergraduate mathematics, statistics and actuarial science majors. </p> <p> The major differences between this edition and the fifth edition are: </p> <ul> <li>It is easier to find various items because more definitions, equations, and theorems are given by chapter, section, and display numbers. Moreover, many theorems, definitions, and examples are given names in bold faced type for easier reference.</li> <li>Many of the distribution finding techniques, such as transformations and moment generating methods, are in the first three chapters. The concepts of expectation and conditional expectation are treated more thoroughly in the first two chapters.</li> <li>Chapter 3 on special distributions now includes contaminated normal distributions, the multivariate normal distribution, the <i>t</i>- and <i>F</i>-distributions, and a section on mixture distributions.</li> <li>Chapter 4 presents large sample theory on convergence in probability and 1 distribution and ends with the Central Limit Theorem. In the first semester, if the instructor is pressed for time he or she can omit this chapter and proceed to Chapter 5.</li> <li>To enable the instructor to include some statistical inference in the first semester, Chapter 5 introduces sampling, confidence intervals and testing. These include many of the normal theory procedures for one and two sample location problems and the corresponding large sample procedures. The chapter concludes with an introduction to Monte Carlo techniques and bootstrap procedures for confidence intervals and testing. These procedures are used throughout the later chapters of the book.</li> <li>Maximum likelihood methods, Chapter 6, have been expanded. For illustration, the regularity conditions have been listed which allows us to provide better proofs of a number of associated theorems, such as the limiting distributions of the maximum likelihood procedures. This forms a more complete inference for these important methods. The EM algorithm is discussed and is applied to several maximum likelihood situations.</li> <li>Chapters 7-9 contain material on sufficient statistics, optimal tests of hypotheses, and inferences about normal models.</li> <li>Chapters 10-12 contain new material. Chapter 10 presents nonparametric procedures for the location models and simple linear regression. It presents estimation and confidence intervals as well as testing. Sections on optimal scores and adaptive methods are presented. Chapter 11 offers an introduction to Bayesian methods. This includes traditional Bayesian procedures as well as Markov Chain Monte Carlo procedures, including the Gibbs sampler, for hierarchical and empirical Bayes procedures. Chapter 12 offers a comparison of robust and traditional least squares methods for linear models. It introduces the concepts of influence functions and breakdown points for estimators. Not every instructor will include these new chapters in a two-semester course, but those interested in one of these areas will find their inclusion very worthwhile. These last three chapters are independent of one another.</li> <li>We have occasionally made use of the statistical softwares R, (Ihaka and Gentleman, 1996), and S-PLUS, (S-PLUS, 2000), in this edition; see Venables and Ripley (2002). Students do not need resource to these packages to use the text but the use of one (or that of another package) does add a computational flavor. The package R is freeware which can be downloaded for free at the site: http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/</li> <li>There are versions of R for unix, pc and mac platforms. We have written some R functions for several procedures in the text. These we have listed in Appendix B but they can also be downloaded at the site: http://www.stat.wmich.edu/mckean/HMC/Rcode - These functions will run in S-PLUS also.</li> <li>The reference list has been expanded so that instructors and students can find the original sources better.</li> <li>The order of presentation has been greatly improved and more exercises have been added. As a matter of fact, there are now over one thousand exercises and, further, many new examples have been added.</li> </ul> <p> Most instructors will find selections from the first nine chapters sufficient for a two-semester course. However, we hope that many will want to insert one of the three topic chapters into their course. As a matter of fact, there is really enough material for a three semester sequence, which at one time we taught at the University of Iowa. A few optional sections have been marked with an asterisk. </p> <p> We would like to thank the following reviewers who read through earlier versions of the manuscript: Walter Freiberger, Brown University; John Leahy, University of Oregon; Bradford Crain, Portland State University; Joseph S.

They challenge arguments that expanding inequality is the natural, perhaps necessary, accompaniment of economic growth. They refute the claims of the incendiary bestseller <i>The Bell Curve</i> (1994) through a clear, rigorous re-analysis of the very data its authors, Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray, used to contend that inherited differences in intelligence explain inequality. <i>Inequality by Design</i> offers a powerful alternative explanation, stressing that economic fortune depends more on social circumstances than on IQ, which is itself a product of society. More critical yet, patterns of inequality must be explained by looking beyond the attributes of individuals to the structure of society. Social policies set the "rules of the game" within which individual abilities and efforts matter. And recent policies have, on the whole, widened the gap between the rich and the rest of Americans since the 1970s.</p><br><p> Not only does the wealth of individuals' parents shape their chances for a good life, so do national policies ranging from labor laws to investments in education to tax deductions. The authors explore the ways that America--the most economically unequal society in the industrialized world--unevenly distributes rewards through regulation of the market, taxes, and government spending. It attacks the myth that inequality fosters economic growth, that reducing economic inequality requires enormous welfare expenditures, and that there is little we can do to alter the extent of inequality. It also attacks the injurious myth of innate racial inequality, presenting powerful evidence that racial differences in achievement are the consequences, not the causes, of social inequality. By refusing to blame inequality on an unchangeable human nature and an inexorable market--an excuse that leads to resignation and passivity--<i>Inequality by Design</i> shows how we can advance policies that widen opportunity for all.</p></p><p><p>"<i>Inequality by Design</i>'s most important findings describe an America deeply stratified by class, an America in which equal opportunity remains only and idle dream...[It] may well after the public discussion...with a shot across the bow of the nation's policymakers."--<i>Lingua Franca</i></p><p>"One of the most important books on what divides America socially and economically since the work of Christopher Jencks and his Harvard colleagues nearly a quarter century ago."--<i>Daniel Bell</i></p><p></p><p>"The authors of this compelling new study rebut the wrong-headed work of Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein by mobilizing powerful evidence to demonstrate that inequality is a structural problem, not a hereditary condition.... One of the most important books on what divides America socially and economically since the work of Christopher Jencks and his Harvard colleagues nearly a quarter century ago."<b>--Daniel Bell</b></p></p><h2>Heirs of the Covenant: Leaving a Legacy of Faith for the Next Generation</h2><p><p>True Christian education offers far more than secular education methods sprinkled with Bible stories. It teaches people of every age to think and live Christianly. And it makes teachers of us all. Whether you're a parent or grandparent, a Sunday school or Christian school teacher, or a youth leader or pastor, you are responsible to help develop the community of believers into a unified, vibrant fellowship; to draw families together in committed relationships that extend beyond generational lines; and to live out God's covenant with His people in a way that makes authentic Christianity come alive.</p> <p>This practical plan for integrating Christian education into all of life shows what happens when, day by day, week by week, generation by generation, the church leads its people into the privileges and responsibilities of covenant living. Regardless of your role in God's Kingdom, <em>Heirs of the Covenant</em> will motivate you to leave a legacy of faith for the next generation&#x2014;and to live for Christ today in your home, church, and community.</p></p><p></p><h2>Auditing and Accounting Cases: Investigating Issues of Fraud and Professional Ethics</h2><p>The approach used by Thibodeau and Freier emphasizes the substantial benefits of using real-life case examples in helping to impart knowledge related to the practice of auditing. For the fourth edition of <strong><em>Auditing and Accounting Cases: Investigating Issues of Fraud and Professional Ethics</em></strong> the authors continue their quest to be known as the most current auditing and accounting case book on the market. In that spirit, all case questions in the fourth edition have been revised to incorporate the eight new standards adopted by the PCAOB (i.e., AS 8 - AS 15) that relate to the auditor's assessment of and response to risk in an audit and that include guidance related to audit planning, supervision, materiality, and evidence.<p> This flexible case book is perfect for educators to prepare future audit professionals with 45 cases focusing on specific and relevant audit issues. These cases focus on specific auditing issues directly impacted by Sarbanes Oxley and Dodd-Frank, using the actual companies-Madoff, Enron, WorldCom, Quest, Sunbeam-that have become synonymous with the capital markets' crisis in confidence.</p></p><p>Jay C.

Yet amid this turn to wholesome and responsible food choices, the lives and working conditions of farmworkers are often an afterthought.<br><br><i>Labor and the Locavore</i> focuses on one of the most vibrant local food economies in the country, the Hudson Valley that supplies New York restaurants and farmers markets. Based on more than a decade&#x2019;s in-depth interviews with workers, farmers, and others, Gray&#x2019;s examination clearly shows how the currency of agrarian values serves to mask the labor concerns of an already hidden workforce. <br><br>She also explores the historical roots of farmworkers&#x2019; predicaments and examines the ethnic shift from Black to Latino workers. With an analysis that can be applied to local food concerns around the country, this book challenges the reader to consider how the mentality of the alternative food movements implies a comprehensive food ethic that addresses workers&#x2019; concerns.<br><br></p><p>"<i>Labor and the Locavore</i> is a timely and important antidote to much of today's popular food writing on eating local. Forthright and rigorous in its depiction of labor conditions on small farms in New York's Hudson Valley&#x2015;the hub of the New York City local food system&#x2015;Margaret Gray shows that labor abuses are not unique to industrial scale agriculture&#x2015;or to California." &#x2015;Julie Guthman, author of <i>Weighing In: Obesity, Food Justice, and the Limits of Capitalism</i><br> <br> "Small may be beautiful; when local it may be even better. But as Margaret Gray&#x2019;s beautifully written ethnography shows, the romance with the small and the local focuses on the conditions under which produce is grown while ignoring the conditions endured by the immigrant workers planting, picking, and tending the locally grown food that socially conscious consumers so desire. Focusing on that iconic symbol&#x2015;the small, family-owned farm&#x2015;this carefully researched, extensively documented book sheds new light on the ways in which immigration has transformed all corners of American life and in so doing has confronted farmers, consumers, and workers alike with difficult yet ultimately resolvable dilemmas." &#x2015;Roger Waldinger, author of <i>How the Other Half Works: Immigration and the Social Organization of Labor</i>Margaret Gray is Associate Professor of Political Science at Adelphi University.</p><h2>Capitalism without Capital: The Rise of the Intangible Economy</h2><p>Early in the twenty-first century, a quiet revolution occurred. For the first time, the major developed economies began to invest more in intangible assets, like design, branding, and software, than in tangible assets, like machinery, buildings, and computers. For all sorts of businesses, the ability to deploy assets that one can neither see nor touch is increasingly the main source of long-term success. But this is not just a familiar story of the so-called new economy. <i>Capitalism without Capital</i> shows that the growing importance of intangible assets has also played a role in some of the larger economic changes of the past decade, including the growth in economic inequality and the stagnation of productivity. Jonathan Haskel and Stian Westlake explore the unusual economic characteristics of intangible investment and discuss how an economy rich in intangibles is fundamentally different from one based on tangibles. <i>Capitalism without Capital</i> concludes by outlining how managers, investors, and policymakers can exploit the characteristics of an intangible age to grow their businesses, portfolios, and economies.</p><p><p>"The nineteenth- and twentieth-century world where capitalists owned factories and workers supplied labor has ended. In this book, Haskel and Westlake explain with fascinating examples how business assets today are mostly intangible and how this changes everything we know about business--corporate strategy, accounting, leadership, and industrial strategy. Whether you are a customer, investor, manager, employee, or politician, you will gain new insights from this tour de force."<b>--John Kay, author of <i>Other People's Money</i></b></p><p>"A must-read for anyone concerned about how to revive the growth of living standards."<b>--Robert Peston, author of <i>How Do We Fix This Mess?: The Economic Price of Having It All and the Route to Lasting Prosperity</i></b></p><p>"On almost every page of this book I found myself going 'Oh, now I understand' or 'Yes, I never looked at it that way.' <i>Capitalism without Capital</i> is highly original and illuminating.

What does it mean to "fall" asleep? Might there exist something like a "reason" of sleep, a reason at work in its own form or modality, a modality of being in oneself, of return to oneself, without the waking "self" that distinguishes "I" from "you" and from the world? What reason might exist in that absence of ego, appearance, and intention, in an abandon thanks to which one is emptied out into a non-place shared by everyone?<br><br>Sleep attests to something like an equality of all that exists in the rhythm of the world. With sleep, victory is constantly renewed over the fear of night, an a confidence that we will wake with the return of day, in a return to self, to us--though to a self, an us, that is each day different, unforeseen, without any warning given in advance.<br>To seek anew the meaning stirring in the supposed loss of meaning, of consciousness, and of control that occurs in sleep is not to reclaim some meaning already familiar in philosophy, religion, progressivism, or any other -ism. It is instead to open anew a source that is not the source of a meaning but that makes up the nature proper to meaning, its truth: opening, gushing forth, infinity.<br><br>This beautiful, profound meditation on sleep is a unique work in the history of phenomenology--a lyrical phenomenology of what can have no phenomenology, since sleep shows itself to the waking observer, the subject of phenomenology, only as disappearance and concealment.</p></p><p><b>Jean-Luc Nancy</b> is Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the Universit� Marc Bloch, Strasbourg. His wide-ranging thought is developed in many books, including <i>Expectation: Philosophy, Literature</i>; <i>The Possibility of a World</i>; <i>The Banality of Heidegger</i>; <i>The Disavowed Community</i>; and, with Ad�le Van Reeth, <i>Coming</i> (all Fordham).A truly original examination of the most universally overlooked human experience. (&#x2015;Sarah Clift <i>University of King&#x2019;s College, Halifax</i>)<br><br>What happens to the subject when sleep descends? If philosophy has always supposed consciousness, what happens in the "fall of sleep," when intention, will, deliberation and its correlates are suspended? Nancy traces, not an absence of subjectivity, but another formation of the "I" in this meditative text -- part thesis and part reverie, as much a nocturne as a treatise -- and guides us toward the province of Morpheus. (&#x2015;Charles Shepherdson <i>University at Abany, State University of New York</i>)<br><br>A beguiling set of reflections on a topic that has to be among those most resistant to philosophy and philosophizing: sleep. After reading Nancy, one will think differently about this enigmatic fact of life and how we talk about it. (&#x2015;Ian Balfour <i>York University</i>)<br><br><p>The Fall of Sleep is Nancy's most lyrical, most beautiful work. It is also <br>acute in tracing the limits of a phenomenology of sleep: for sleep is the disappearance of the self. Yet that dark self is also the Kantian thing in <br>itself. So proposes Nancy in his noumenology of sleep. . .</p> (&#x2015;Kevin Hart <i>The University of Virginia</i>)<br><br>. . . [A] brief siesta of an inquiry into slumber. (<i>&#x2015;The Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>A quarter-century ago Jean-Luc Nancy remarked that "Sleep, perhaps, has never been philosophical." Philosophy, after all, ruins sleep. In The Fall of Sleep Nancy explores the singularities of sleep as (among other things) an experience of freedom and a sojourn for lovers.

Despite stern warnings, visitors remove several tons of petrified wood from the park each year, often returning these rocks by mail (sometimes years later), accompanied by a "conscience letter." These letters often include stories of misfortune attributed directly to their theft: car troubles, cats with cancer, deaths of family members, etc. Some writers hope that by returning these stolen rocks, good fortune will return to their lives, while others simply apologize or ask forgiveness. "They are beautiful," reads one letter, "but I can't enjoy them. They weigh like a ton of bricks on my conscience. Sorry...." <i>Bad Luck, Hot Rocks</i> documents this ongoing phenomenon, combining a series of original photographs of these otherworldly "bad luck rocks" with facsimiles of intimate, oddly entertaining letters from the park's archives.</p></p><p><i>Bad Luck, Hot Rocks</i> is part of Thompson's exploration of that relationship, in particular the significance that people attach to geologic oddities.

In Part Two, clinical vignettes illustrate in user-friendly detail the application of such techniques as puppet interviews, art therapy, and story-telling. Dr. Gil covers the presenting problems and family configurations clinicians are likely to encounter when working with children. Throughout, the text describes the problems that may arise--such as family members' reluctance to use play--and shows how to overcome them by setting a positive tone and conveying the expectation that families will find play enjoyable and rewarding.<br><br>Providing clinicians with useful play techniques with which to expand their repertoire of family interventions, this work will be invaluable to all therapists and students who work with children and their families. <br></p><p><p>Eliana Gil, PhD, is senior partner in a private group practice in Fairfax, Virginia, the Gil Institute for Trauma Recovery and Education, which provides therapy, consulting, and training services.

While American warriors were fighting the length of the country, other Americans were courageously working alongside to preserve the irreplaceable best of Italy's culture. Read it and be proud of those who were on their own front lines of a cruel war. --Tom Brokaw<br><br>Robert Edsel has written a captivating, and at times hair-raising, book on the audacious Allied effort during World War II to save the priceless art treasurers in Italy. It is impossible to imagine what Western civilization would be today without these cultural masterpieces. Edsel has written a gripping, heroic story of the Monuments Men who saved them from certain destruction. --Susan Eisenhower<br><br>As Robert Edsel shows us in this valuable book, the artistic patrimony of the western world was a hostage to Hitler's legions in 1945. Saving Italy rescues an unlikely troop of American heroes from obscurity, chronicling the exploits of a band of art professors working for the U.S. military as they saved Tuscany's masterworks, museums and cathedrals from oblivion as Nazi Germany's southern flank crumbled. --James D. Hornfischer, bestselling author of "Neptune s Inferno"<br><br>Robert Edsel weaves a suspenseful tale worthy of an Indiana Jones plot. He pulls you into a dangerous web of intrigue in which the Vatican, top German SS generals, American OSS operatives and Italian officials are entwined in top-secret negotiations to end the war. A must read for any WWII history enthusiast. --Gordon H. Nick Mueller, President/CEO, The National WWII Museum<br><br>Eventually the deranged plots of the Nazis called forth a new breed of adversary, their college degrees in art and antiquities hardly imposing yet suddenly critical, their extraordinary confrontation with evil quickly proving capable, in this inspired account, of recasting the war in Italy into a barn-burner of a history. --Hugh Ambrose, bestselling author of "The Pacific"<br><br>An amazing story, superbly told. The narrative and research are exceptionally well done. Edsel has done a great service not only to tell the story of the Monuments Men and the work they did in Italy but also to remind mankind what the Germans did. I believe that Saving Italy is a major contribution to the history of World War II. --Carlo D Este, bestselling author of "Patton: A Genius For War"<br><br>Edsel's recovery of the history of the Monuments Men makes for a remarkable and fascinating story. As more recent conflicts have shown, the havoc that war can wreak upon our artistic heritage has unfortunately not diminished and there are important lessons in this book for policy makers and all who care about the preservation of the world's artistic legacy for future generations. --Timothy Potts, Director, the J. Paul Getty Museum<br><br>Edsel's knowledge and appreciation of art amplifies this celebration of the unheralded group of men who ensured the safety of Italy's greatest treasures.<br><br>Saving Italy is a teeming work...by an author passionate about his subject. --Matthew Price</p><h2>Nasty People: How to Stop Being Hurt by Them without Stooping to Their Level</h2><p><p>Fourteen years since its first publication, the bestseller<i>Nasty People </i>has been revised and updated to cover the motivations of nasty people, how to avoid confrontation with a nasty boss, how to handle a nasty spouse, and much more, including:</p> <ul> <li>How to break the cycle of nastiness </li><li>A new understanding of personality disorders and depression </li><li>Narcissism, nasty behavior, and self-doubt </li><li>Nasty people and self-validation </li><li>The role adrenaline plays in nasty behavior and our responses to it. </li></ul> <p>Everyone knows a person who has been hurt, betrayed, or degraded by nasty individuals or has experienced it themselves.

Unlocking the Potential of Urban Students</h2><p>For far too long, disadvantaged students in urban environments have believed the fallacy that academic success is unattainable. Why? The unfortunate answer is that too many urban school systems preemptively declare underperforming students to be failures, a practice that fosters dysfunctional classrooms that fail to motivate, engage, and inspire students to succeed.<br><br>In Create Success!, Kadhir Rajagopal, affectionately known as Dr. Raja to his students, outlines his no-holds-barred approach to teaching urban students. Through his CREATE model of instruction, students are held accountable for their own learning, taught at an appropriate level and in familiar language, and imbued with the sense that learning and personal achievement are qualities of which they should be proud not ashamed. Dr. Raja s CREATE model also places an emphasis on the active participation of teachers, parents, caregivers, and coaches in each student s success.<br><br>Resulting in unprecedented success among students previously dismissed as lost causes and academic failures, the CREATE model has demonstrated that it is indeed possible to close the achievement gap, even in the most difficult cases. Rajagopal has also shown that his model can be replicated in any classroom by a teacher who is willing to assume responsibility for each student s success, hold students accountable, embrace culturally responsive instruction, and vigorously work on behalf of all students.<br><br>Filled with personal insights and battle-tested strategies that promote student achievement, Create Success! is a pioneering approach to urban education from a 2011 California Teacher of the Year.</p><p>At a time when policymakers place so much emphasis on assessment, we finally have a book that addresses the two most critical issues affecting student achievement: effective teaching and student motivation. Several studies have pointed out that algebra is the gateway to college. Kadhir Rajagopal s important new book is an excellent guide that will show educators how to make algebra accessible and engaging to the students who most often experience failure in the subject and are prevented from entering higher level math and science courses. For those who realize that the pursuit of equity in education starts with providing effective teaching to all students, this book will be an invaluable resource. --Pedro Noguera</p><h2>Maigret&#39;s Secret (Inspector Maigret)</h2><p><b><b><b>&#x201c;One of the greatest writers of the twentieth century . . .

Adrien had been a weak-willed, mild-mannered man, but Christine, who was much wealthier than he, had used her connections to land him an influential position in an important career. Maigret had interviewed Adrien only once when the examining magistrate took over the case and successfully moved to have him executed. But though all the clues pointed to Adrien&#x2019;s guilt, Maigret remained unconvinced, and years later, he still doubts the murderer&#x2019;s true identity.<br><br> <i>Maigret&#x2019;s Secret</i> is a thought-provoking dive into the machinations of justice, and the ways in which they can sweep away an innocent man&#x2019;s life.</p><p><b>Georges Simenon&nbsp;</b>(1903-1989) was born in Li�ge, Belgium.

When she's not traipsing after a rabbit into Wonderland, she's gallivanting off into the topsy-turvy world behind the drawing-room looking glass. In <i>Through the Looking Glass</i>, Lewis Carroll's masterful and zany sequel to <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>, she makes more eccentric acquaintances, including Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the White Queen, and a somewhat grumpy Humpty Dumpty. Through a giant and elaborate chess game, Alice explores this odd country, where one must eat dry biscuits to quench thirst, and run like the wind to stay in one place. As in life, Alice must stay on her toes to learn the rules of this game. <i>Through the Looking Glass</i> immediately took its rightful place beside its partner on the shelf of eternal classics. And luckily for generations of enraptured children, Carroll was again able to persuade John Tenniel to create the fantastic woodblock engravings that have become so indelibly associated with the Alice stories. For almost 130 years, Alice's curious adventures have amused, perplexed, and delighted readers, young and old. This gorgeous, deluxe boxed set of both volumes contains engravings from Tenniel's original woodblocks that were discovered in a London bank in 1985, and reproduced for the first time here. "'What is the use of a book,' thought Alice, 'without pictures?'" What indeed? (All ages)Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.</p><h2>Empathy and the Novel</h2><p>Does empathy felt while reading fiction actually cultivate a sense of connection, leading to altruistic actions on behalf of real others? <em>Empathy and the Novel</em> presents a comprehensive account of the relationships among novel reading, empathy, and altruism. Drawing on psychology, narrative theory, neuroscience, literary history, philosophy, and recent scholarship in discourse processing, Keen brings together resources and challenges for the literary study of empathy and the psychological study of fiction reading. Empathy robustly enters into affective responses to fiction, yet its role in shaping the behavior of emotional readers has been debated for three centuries. Keen surveys these debates and illustrates the techniques that invite empathetic response. She argues that the perception of fictiveness increases the likelihood of readers' empathy in part by releasing them from the guarded responses necessitated by the demands of real others. Narrative empathy is a strategy and subject of contemporary novelists from around the world, writers who tacitly endorse the potential universality of human emotions when they call upon their readers' empathy. If narrative empathy is to be taken seriously, Keen suggests, then women's reading and responses to popular fiction occupy a central position in literary inquiry, and cognitive literary studies should extend its range beyond canonical novels. In short, Keen's study extends the playing field for literature practitioners, causing it to resemble more closely that wide open landscape inhabited by readers.<br></p><p><br><strong>Suzanne Keen</strong>, Thomas H. Broadus Professor of English at Washington and Lee University, is the author of <em>Narrative Form</em> (2003), <em>Romances of the Archive in Contemporary British Fiction</em> (2001), <em>Victorian Renovations of the Novel: Narrative Annexes and the Boundaries of Representation</em> (1998), and a volume of poetry, <em>Milk Glass Mermaid </em> (2007).<br><br>"<em>Empathy and the Novel</em> belongs in the company of Peter Brooks' <em>Reading for the Plot</em> as an exciting and lucid reflection on empathy in the novel and on the empathetic effects of narrative on readers. Working at the cross-section of literature, neuroscience, and psychology, the book is a stunningly original, broad-ranging contribution to narrative ethics and to the meanings of emotion in literature, life, and human society." --Susan Stanford Friedman, Virginia Woolf Professor of English and Women's Studies, University of Wisconsin-Madison <br><p></p><br>"Drawing on cognitive science, narrative theory, and the sociology of reading, <em>Empathy and the Novel</em> challenges the received wisdom about the ethical effects of novel-reading. That identification leads to empathy and empathy to altruism has been one of the axioms of novel criticism, repeated in different terms from the eighteenth century to the present. Keen replaces those easy pieties by a subtler account of emotional response which nonetheless accounts for the centrality of empathy to ordinary readers' accounts of their own experience." --Leah Price, author of <em>The Anthology and the Rise</em> <em>of the Novel</em><p></p><br>"<em>Empathy and the Novel</em> . . . helps us read more distinctly the written record of the nineteenth-century novelists and critics who put overwhelming faith in the sympathetic work of the novel as a form." --<em>Victorian Studies</em><p></p><br>"Suzanne Keen calls into question the widespread assumption that imaginative engagement with fictional works can help us become more empathetic and more ethical persons. Lively, incisive, sobering, and deeply instructive, <em>Empathy and the Novel</em> will prove of great interest to those working on narrative, on the psychology of reading, on ethics and literature, and on popular fiction, while making a key contribution to the new field of cognitive literary studies." --Alan Richardson, Professor of English, Boston College<p></p><br></p><h2>High Yoga: Enhance Yoga with Cannabis and CBD Treatments for Relaxation, Healing, and Bliss (Gift for Yoga Lover, Cannabis Book for Stress and Anxiety Relief)</h2><p>Yogis have been using marijuana to enhance yoga practice for centuries.

For more than two decades, he faces the wrath of nature and the struggle to stay alive with little more than his wits to save him.

Read variously as economic fable, religious allegory, or imperialist fantasy, Crusoe has never lost its appeal as one of the most compelling adventure stories of all time.

Drawing on recently declassified CIA documents, Jones deftly examines the train of missteps and self-deceptions that led to the invasion of U.S.-trained exiles at the Bay of Pigs. <br>Ignoring warnings from the ambassador to Cuba, the Eisenhower administration put in motion an operation that proved nearly unstoppable even after the inauguration of John F. Kennedy. The CIA and Pentagon, meanwhile, both voiced confidence in the outcome of the invasion, especially after coordinating previous successful coups in Guatemala and Iran. And so the Kennedy administration launched the exile force toward its doom in Cochinos Bay on April 17, 1961. Jones gives a riveting account of the battle--and the confusion in the White House--before moving on to explore its implications. The Bay of Pigs, he writes, set the course of Kennedy's foreign policy. It was a humiliation for the administration that fueled fears of Communist domination and pushed Kennedy toward a hardline "cold warrior" stance. But at the same time, the failed attack left him deeply skeptical of CIA and military advisers and influenced his later actions during the Cuban missile crisis.<br></p><p><br><strong>Howard Jones</strong> is the author of <em>Mutiny on the Amistad</em> and <em>Death of a Generation</em>.

Here is an altogether new, refreshing, alternative history of math revealing how simple questions anyone might ask about space -- in the living room or in some other galaxy -- have been the hidden engine of the highest achievements in science and technology. <br> Based on Mlodinow's extensive historical research; his studies alongside colleagues such as Richard Feynman and Kip Thorne; and interviews with leading physicists and mathematicians such as Murray Gell-Mann, Edward Witten, and Brian Greene, <i>Euclid's Window</i> is an extraordinary blend of rigorous, authoritative investigation and accessible, good-humored storytelling that makes a stunningly original argument asserting the primacy of geometry. For those who have looked through <i>Euclid's Window,</i> no space, no thing, and no time will ever be quite the same.</p><p>"How do you know where you are?" asks Leonard Mlodinow in his charming mathematical history, <i>Euclid's Window</i>. This question and others about space and time grew out of simple observations of the environment by a select group of thinkers whose lives and brains Mlodinow dissects. Starting with Euclid, geometry has flowed out over the centuries, describing the universe, and, Mlodinow argues, making modern civilization possible.<p> This is not just a history of geometry--it's a timeline of reason and abstraction, with all the major players present: Euclid, Descartes, Gauss, Einstein, and Witten, each represented by a minibiography. </p><p> Lots of examples pepper the narrative to help readers achieve their own "eureka!" And it's impossible not to be staggered at the mathematical feats of these geniuses, accomplished as many of them were in the absence of anything but observation and intense thought. Each story builds satisfactorily on the last, until at the end of this delightful book, one has a sense of having climbed a peak of understanding.</p><p> A working knowledge of basic geometry is helpful but not essential for enjoying <i>Euclid's Window</i>, and Mlodinow's chatty style lends itself remarkably well to explaining these deep and revolutionary concepts. <i>--Adam Fisher</i></p><b>Leonard Mlodinow, Ph.D.,</b> was a member of the faculty of the California Institute of Technology before moving to Hollywood to become a writer for numerous television shows ranging from <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i> to <i>Night Court.</i> He has also developed many bestselling and award-winning educational CD-ROMs, and delivered technical and general lectures in ten countries.

Levy in this fascinating history of the origins of the Bill of Rights. Unencumbered by a rigid class system, an arbitrary government, or a single established church squelching dissent, colonial Americans understood freedom in a far more comprehensive and liberal way than the English, Levy shows. He offers here a panoramic view of the liberties secured by the first ten amendments to the Constitution&#x2015;a penetrating analysis of the background of the Bill of Rights the meanings of each provision of the amendments.<br><br>In colonial America, political theory, law, and religion all taught that government was limited. Yet the framing and ratification of the Bill of Rights&#x2015;in effect a bill of restraints upon the national government&#x2015;was by no means assured. Levy illuminates the behind-the-scenes maneuverings, public rhetoric, and political motivations that led to each provision. The omission of a bill of rights in the original constitution presented the most serious obstacle to its adoption, despite Federalist claims that a bill of rights was unnecessary. Opponents of the Constitution claimed that inclusion of only some liberties&#x2015;such as the right to habeas corpus and freedom from ex post facto laws&#x2015;meant that all other liberties would be lost. But, Levy demonstrates, the people of the United States, aided by a persistent James Madison and by traditions of freedom, had the good sense to support both the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.</p><p>Yale Contemporary Law Series<b>Leonard W.

With powerful techniques for resolving or at least reducing conflicts, scholars and teachers from around the globe demystify the intricate and important relationship between conflict and culture. <br><br>Stories, which are at the heart of the book, come from a wide variety of groups and locations, and they give sound counsel for all kinds of settings: business, law, government, non-governmental agencies, schools, communities and families. <i>Conflict across Cultures</i> is written by a new generation of conflict resolution scholars from four parts of the world: Canada, South Africa, Japan and the US. They describe processes and help build the skills necessary for successful conflict resolution. Here is a new framework for understanding others-a map for making progress through differences that can otherwise overwhelm us. <i>Conflict across Cultures</i> offers hope in countering the view that differences must divide us.</p><p>"<i>Conflict Across Cultures</i> is a rare breed of work combining theory and practice, real life stories and metaphor, critical analysis and holistic approaches. The end result is a book that is remarkably readable, and even more valuable for its contribution to understanding the problems that underpin virtually every major conflict in the world today. <p>This is one of the few works on culture and conflict resolution that actually practices what it preaches. The authors have drawn on their own cultural diversity to produce a framework that can be used by conflict resolution practitioners and laypeople from all walks of life."<br> <i>-Ambassador John W. McDonald, Chairman, The Institute for Multi-Track Diplomacy</i> </p><p>Learning to handle cross-cultural conflict is emerging as a central problem in human relations. And no one is better qualified to describe the intricate ins and outs of that learning process than the extraordinary - and extraordinarily honest - team that has written <i>Conflict Across Cultures.</i>"<br><i>-Christpher Honeyman, Conflict Management Consultant and Co-Editor, </i>The Negotiator's Fieldbook </p><p>"Michelle and colleagues fused, with elegance, their substantial knowledge in the fields of peace, conflict and culture, with stories and experiences, and artistic imagination which made reading this book like a walk in terrain, or a swim in the river...with pleasant friends."<br><i>-Amr Abdalla, Ph.D., Professor and Dean for academic Programmes, University for Peace, United Nations Affiliated University</i> </p><p>"<i>Conflict Across Cultures</i> teaches how each of us can build bridges across the chasms that separate different cultures. With insights born of rich experiences, the authors explore metaphor, ritual and storytelling to help people understand one another, and by helping us to recognize what is sacred to others, they help us to find our own sacred ground."<br><i>-Dr. Mary-Wynne Ashford, International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War</i></p>Michelle Lebaron is professor of law and director of the UBC Program on Dispute Resolution.

Ian Hodder and Scott Hutson argue that archaeologists must consider a variety of perspectives in the complex and uncertain task of &#34;translating the meaning of past texts into their own contemporary language&#34;. While remaining centered on the importance of meaning, agency and history, the authors explore the latest developments in post-structuralism, neo-evolutionary theory and phenomenology.

Following older artist Robert Henri's insistence that artists should make "pictures from life," the Ashcanners renounced the polished academic style taught in art schools of the time. Instead they practiced a more urgent manner working with bold, highly saturated color, seeking to catch the ebb and flow of life in urban America. Some of them, particularly Bellows,&nbsp;also produced vivid landscapes and portraits. </p><p>This book introduces the artists of the Ashcan School and the key characteristics and themes of their work. Detailed commentaries are provided for twelve significant paintings by George Bellows, William Glackens, Robert Henri, George Luks, and John Sloan, ranging from depictions of the metropolitan throng to Bellows's vivid seascapes. In their visual contemplation of early-20th-century America, these artists offer deep insights into the nature of ordinary life not only in their time but also in our own.</p></p><p><b>David Peters Corbett</b> is Dean, Faculty of Arts and Humanities, University of East Anglia.

Today they are one of the most significant Native groups in the Pacific Northwest, although the Chinook Tribe is still unrecognized by the United States government. In <i>Chinookan Peoples of the Lower Columbia River</i>, scholars provide a deep and wide-ranging picture of the landscape and resources of the Chinookan homeland and the history and culture of a people over time, from 10,000 years ago to the present. They draw on research by archaeologists, ethnologists, scientists, and historians, inspired in part by the discovery of several Chinookan village sites, particularly Cathlapotle, a village on the Columbia River floodplain near the Portland-Vancouver metropolitan area. Their accumulated scholarship, along with contributions by members of the Chinook and related tribes, provides an introduction to Chinookan culture and research and is a foundation for future work.</p><p><b>Robert T.

She died in 1968.</p>I<br><br>All the Venables sat at Sunday dinner. All those handsome inbred Venable faces were turned, enthralled, toward Yancey Cravat, who was talking. The combined effect was almost blinding, as of incandescence; but Yancey Cravat was not bedazzled. A sun surrounded by lesser planets, he gave out a radiance so powerful as to dim the luminous circle about him.<br><br>Yancey had a disconcerting habit of abruptly concluding a meal&#x2014;�for himself, at least&#x2014;�by throwing down his napkin at the side of his plate, rising, and striding about the room, or even leaving it. It was not deliberate rudeness. He ate little. His appetite satisfied, he instinctively ceased to eat; ceased to wish to contemplate food. But the Venables sat hours at table, leisurely shelling almonds, sipping sherry; Cousin Dabney Venable peeling an orange for Cousin Bella French Vian with the absorbed concentration of a sculptor molding his clay.<br><br>The Venables, dining, strangely resembled one of those fertile and dramatic family groups portrayed lolling unconventionally at meat in the less spiritual of those Biblical canvases that glow richly down at one from the great gallery walls of Europe. Though their garb was sober enough, being characteristic of the time&#x2014;�1889&#x2014;�and the place&#x2014;�Kansas&#x2014;�it yet conveyed an impression as of purple and scarlet robes enveloping these gracile shoulders. You would not have been surprised to see, moving silently about this board, Nubian blacks in loincloths, bearing aloft golden vessels piled with exotic fruits or steaming with strange pasties in which nightingales&#x2019; tongues figured prominently. Blacks, as a matter of fact, did move about the Venable table, but these, too, wore the conventional garb of the servitor.<br><br>This branch of the Venable family tree had been transplanted from Mississippi to Kansas more than two decades before, but the mid-�west had failed to set her bourgeois stamp upon them. Straitened though it was, there still obtained in that household, by some genealogical miracle, many of those charming ways, remotely Oriental, that were of the South whence they had sprung. The midday meal was, more often than not, a sort of tribal feast at which sprawled hosts of impecunious kin, mysteriously sprung up at the sound of the dinner bell and the scent of baking meats. Unwilling �migr�s, war ruined, Lewis Venable and his wife Felice had brought their dear customs with them into exile, as well as the superb mahogany oval at which they now sat, and the war-�salvaged silver which gave elegance to the Wichita, Kansas, board. Certainly the mahogany had suffered in transit; and many of their Southern ways, transplanted to Kansas, seemed slightly silly&#x2014;�or would have, had they not been tinged with pathos. The hot breads of the South, heaped high at every meal, still wrought alimentary havoc. The frying pan and the deep-�fat kettle (both, perhaps, as much as anything responsible for the tragedy of &#x2019;64) still spattered their deadly fusillade in this household. Indeed, the creamy pallor of the Venable women, so like that of a magnolia petal in their girlhood, and tending so surely toward the ocherous in middle age, was less a matter of pigment than of liver. Impecunious though the family now was, three or four negro servants went about the house, soft-�footed, slack, charming. &#x201c;Rest yo&#x2019; wrap?&#x201d; they suggested, velvet voiced and hospitable, as you entered the wide hallway that was at once so bare and so cluttered. And, &#x201c;Beat biscuit, Miss Adeline?&#x201d; as they proffered a fragrant plate.<br><br>Even that Kansas garden was of another latitude. Lean hounds drowsed in the sun-�drenched untidiness of the doorway, and that untidiness was hidden and transformed by a miracle of color and scent and bloom. Here were passion flower and wistaria and even Bougainvillea in season. Honeysuckle gave out its swooning sweetness. In the early spring lilies of the valley thrust the phantom green of their spears up through the dead brown banking the lilac bushes. That coarse vulgarian, the Kansas sunflower, was a thing despised of the Venables. If one so much as showed its broad face among the scented �l�gantes of that garden it suffered instant decapitation. On one occasion Felice Venable had been known to ruin a pair of very fine-�tempered embroidery scissors while impetuously acting as headsman. She had even been heard to bewail the absence of Spanish moss in this northerly climate. A neighboring midwest matron, miffed, resented this.<br><br>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s a parasite! And real creepy, almost. I was in South Carolina and saw it. Kind of floating, like ghosts. And no earthly good.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do even the flowers have to be useful in Kansas?&#x201d; drawled Felice Venable. She was not very popular with the bustling wives of Wichita. They resented her ruffled and trailing white wrappers of cross-�barred dimity; her pointed slippers, her arched instep, her indifference to all that went on outside the hedge that surrounded the Venable yard; they resented the hedge itself, symbol of exclusiveness in that open-�faced Kansas town. Sheathed in the velvet of Felice Venable&#x2019;s languor was a sharp-�edged poniard of wit inherited from her French forbears, the old Marcys of St. Louis; Missouri fur traders of almost a century earlier. You saw the Marcy mark in the black of her still bountiful hair, in the curve of the brows above the dark eyes&#x2014;�in the dark eyes themselves, so alive in the otherwise immobile face.<br><br>As the family now sat at its noonday meal it was plain that while two decades of living in the Middle West had done little to quicken the speech or hasten the movements of Lewis Venable and his wife Felice (they still &#x201c;you-�alled&#x201d;; they declared to goodness; the eighteenth letter of the alphabet would forever be ah to them) it had made a noticeable difference in the younger generation. Up and down the long table they ranged, sons and daughters, sons-�in-�law and daughters-�in-�law; grandchildren; remoter kin such as visiting nieces and nephews and cousins, offshoots of this far-�flung family. As the more northern-�bred members of the company exclaimed at the tale they now were hearing you noted that their vowels were shorter, their diction more clipped, the turn of the head, the lift of the hand less leisurely. In all those faces there was a resemblance, one to the other. Perhaps the listening look which all of them now wore served to accentuate this.<br><br>It was late May, and unseasonably hot for the altitude. Then, too, there had been an early pest of moths and June flies this spring. High above the table, and directly over it, on a narrow board suspended by rods from the lofty ceiling sat perched Isaiah, the little black boy. With one hand he clung to the side rods of his precarious roost; with the other he wielded a shoofly of feathery asparagus ferns cut from the early garden. Its soft susurrus as he swished it back and forth was an obbligato to the music of Yancey Cravat&#x2019;s golden voice. Clinging thus aloft the black boy looked a simian version of one of Raphael&#x2019;s ceilinged angels. His round head, fuzzed with little tight tufts, as of woolly astrakhan through which the black of his poll gleamed richly, was cocked at an impish angle the better to catch the words that flowed from the lips of the speaker. His eyes, popping with excitement, were fixed in an entrancement on the great lounging figure of Yancey Cravat. So bewitched was the boy that frequently his hand fell limp and he forgot altogether his task of bestirring with his verdant fan the hot moist air above the food-�laden table. An impatient upward glance from Felice Venable&#x2019;s darting black eyes, together with a sharply admonitory &#x201c;Ah-�saiah!&#x201d; would set him to swishing vigorously until the enchantment again stayed his arm.<br><br>The Venables saw nothing untoward in this remnant of Mississippi feudalism. Dozens of Isaiah&#x2019;s forbears had sat perched thus, bestirring the air so that generations of Mississippi Venables might the more agreeably sup and eat and talk. Wichita had first beheld this phenomenon aghast; and even now, after twenty years, it was a subject for local tongue waggings.<br><br>Yancey Cravat was talking. He had been talking for the better part of an hour. This very morning he had returned from the Oklahoma country&#x2014;�the newly opened Indian Territory where he had made the Run that marked the settling of this vast tract of virgin land known colloquially as the Nation. Now, as he talked, the faces of the others had the rapt look of those who listen to a saga. It was the look that Jason&#x2019;s listeners must have had, and Ulysses&#x2019;; and the eager crowd that gathered about Francisco Vasquez de Coronado before they learned that his search for the Seven Cities of Cibolo had been in vain.<br><br>The men at table leaned forward, their hands clasped rather loosely between their knees or on the cloth before them, their plates pushed away, their chairs shoved back. Now and then the sudden white ridge of a hardset muscle showed along the line of a masculine jaw. Their eyes were those of men who follow a game in which they would fain take part. The women listened, a little frightened, their lips parted. They shushed their children when they moved or whimpered, or, that failing, sent them, with a half-�tender, half-�admonitory slap behind, to play in the sunny dooryard. Sometimes a woman&#x2019;s hand reached out possessively, remindingly, and was laid on the arm or the hand of the man seated beside her. &#x201c;I am here,&#x201d; the hand&#x2019;s pressure said. &#x201c;Your place is with me. Don&#x2019;t listen to him like that. Don&#x2019;t believe him. I am your wife. I am safety. I am security. I am comfort. I am habit. I am convention. Don&#x2019;t listen like that. Don&#x2019;t look like that.&#x201d;<br><br>But the man would shake off the hand, not roughly, but with absent-�minded resentment.<br><br>Of all that circlet of faces, linked by the enchantment of the tale now being unfolded before them, there stood out lambent as a flame the face of Sabra Cravat as she sat there at table, her child Cim in her lap. Though she, like her mother Felice Venable, was definitely of the olive-�skinned type, her face seemed luminously white as she listened to the amazing, incredible, and slightly ridiculous story now being unfolded by her husband. It was plain, too, that in her, as in her mother, the strain of the pioneering French Marcys was strong. Her abundant hair was as black, and her eyes; and the strong brows arched with a swooping curve like the twin scimitars that hung above the fireplace in the company room. Sabra was secretly ashamed of her heavy brows and given to surveying them disapprovingly in her mirror while running a forefinger (slightly moistened by her tongue) along their sable curves. For the rest, there was something more New England than Southern in the directness of her glance, the quick turn of her head, the briskness of her speech and manner. Twenty-�one now, married at sixteen, mother of a four-�year-�old boy, and still in love with her picturesque giant of a husband, there was about Sabra Cravat a bloom, a glow, sometimes seen at their exquisite and transitory time in a woman&#x2019;s life when her chemical, emotional, and physical make-�up attains its highest point and fuses.<br><br>It was easy to trace the resemblance, both in face and spirit, between this glowing girl and the sallow woman at the foot of the table. But to turn from her to old Lewis Venable was to find one&#x2019;s self baffled by the mysteries of paternity. Old Lewis Venable was not old, but aged; a futile, fumbling, gentle man, somewhat hag-�ridden and rendered the more unvital by malaria. Face and hands had a yellow ivory quality born of generations subjected to hot breads, lowlands, bad liver, port wine. To say nothing of a resident unexplored bullet somewhere between the third and fifth ribs, got at Murfreesboro as a member of Stanford&#x2019;s Battery, Heavy Artillery, long long before Roentgen had conceived an eye like God&#x2019;s.<br><br>Lewis Venable, in his armchair at the head of the table, was as spellbound as black Isaiah in his high perch above it. Curiously enough, even the boy Cim had listened, or seemed to listen, as he sat in his mother&#x2019;s lap. Sabra had eaten her dinner over the child&#x2019;s head in absent-�minded bites, her eyes always on her husband&#x2019;s face. She rarely had had to say, &#x201c;Hush, Cim, hush!&#x201d; or to wrest a knife or fork or forbidden tidbit from his clutching fingers. Perhaps it was the curiously musical quality of the story-�teller&#x2019;s voice that lulled him. Sabra Venable&#x2019;s disgruntled suitors had said when she married Yancey Cravat, a stranger, mysterious, out of Texas and the Cimarron, that it was his voice that had bewitched her. They were in a measure right, for though Yancey Cravat was verbose, frequently even windy, and though much that he said was dry enough in actual content, he had those priceless gifts of the born orator, a vibrant and flexible voice, great sweetness and charm of manner, an hypnotic eye, and the power of making each listener feel that what was being said was intended for his ear alone. Something of the charlatan was in him, much of the actor, a dash of the fanatic.<br><br>Any tale told by Yancey Cravat was likely to contain enchantment, incredibility (though this last was not present while he was telling it), and a tinge of the absurd. Yancey himself, even at this early time, was a bizarre, glamorous, and slightly mythical figure. No room seemed big enough for his gigantic frame; no chair but dwindled beneath the breadth of his shoulders. He seemed actually to loom more than his six feet two. His black locks he wore overlong, so that they curled a little about his neck in the manner of Booth. His cheeks and forehead were, in places, deeply pitted, as with the pox. Women, perversely enough, found this attractive.<br><br>But first of all you noted his head, his huge head, like a buffalo&#x2019;s, so heavy that it seemed to loll of its own weight. It was with a shock of astonishment that you remarked about him certain things totally at variance with his bulk, his virility, his appearance of enormous power. His mouth, full and sensual, had still an expression of great sweetness. His eyelashes were long and curling, like a beautiful girl&#x2019;s, and when he raised his heavy head to look at you, beneath the long black locks and the dark lashes you saw with something of bewilderment that his eyes were a deep and unfathomable ocean gray.<br><br>Now, in the course of his story, and under the excitement of it, he left the table and sprang to his feet, striding about and talking as he strode. His step was amazingly light and graceful for a man of his powerful frame. Fascinated, you saw that his feet were small and arched like a woman&#x2019;s, and he wore, even in this year of 1889, Texas star boots of fine soft flexible calf, very high heeled, thin soled, and ornamented with cunningly wrought gold stars around the tops. His hands, too, were disproportionate to a man of his stature; slim, pliant, white. He used them as he talked, and the eye followed their movements bewitched. For the rest, his costume was a Prince Albert of fine black broadcloth whose skirts swooped and spread with the vigor of his movements; a pleated white shirt, soft and exquisite material; a black string tie; trousers tucked into the gay boot-�tops; and, always, a white felt hat, broad-�brimmed and rolling. On occasion he simply blubbered Shakespeare, the Old Testament, the Odyssey, the Iliad. His speech was spattered with bits of Latin, and with occasional Spanish phrases, relic of his Texas days.

With his trademark wit and humour, Lucian informs his readers that he means to tell nothing but lies and impossibilities, and warns them not to believe a word he says. The result is a comical masterpiece that influenced Western literature throughout the centuries, and works such as Gulliver&#39;s Travels and The Surprising Adventures of Baron Munchausen. Lucius, or the Ass, a satirical novel charting the adventures of a young man who has been transformed into a donkey, is usually attributed to Lucian and is thought to be a source of Apuleius&#39;s Golden Ass. Contains an introduction by Paul Turner and illustrations by Hellmuth Weissenborn</p><p>Lucian of Samosata was a Greek rhetorician and satirist who flourished in the second century AD.

Rather, the book offers a richly detailed study of the United States' tragic constitutional bargain with slavery, and meanders through the lives of several key figures in antebellum American history along the way. <p> While Thomas Jefferson does play a significant role in Wills' book, the real heroes are the relatively unknown abolitionist Timothy Pickering and, to a lesser degree, John Quincy Adams. Pickering offered a consistent voice of opposition to Jefferson's often secret campaign against Federalist power. Though he could never match Jefferson's charismatic persona, Pickering succeeded in his battle to undo Jefferson's embargo of England--an embargo that Pickering recognized as Jefferson's attempt to undermine the economic prosperity and power of the North. Pickering's ill-fated attempt to secede from the Union, while misguided, would fuel the latter-day abolitionist John Quincy Adams to threaten a similar revolution as the Civil War loomed. </p><p> Ultimately, <i>"Negro President"</i> is a book that recovers slavery as a context for understanding early American political life. At times Willis focuses too much on Jefferson, Pickering, or Adams, and the discussion is derailed by his fascination for the moral successes and failures of each personality. Nevertheless, the book addresses a long-neglected subject in American studies and will prove invaluable to readers interested in understanding America's early struggle to balance Northern versus slave-state power. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>GARRY WILLS, a distinguished historian and critic, is the author of numerous books, including the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning Lincoln at Gettysburg, Saint Augustine, and the best-selling Why I Am a Catholic.<br>A regular contributor to the New York Review of Books, he has won many awards, among them two National Book Critics Circle Awards and the 1998 National Medal for the Humanities.

Determined to create the perfect home there, she finds an idyllic country house set in a lilac grove and sets about furnishing it properly and cooking enormous meals. She even manages to convince her less well-off sister, June, to move into a cozy cottage on the grounds with her husband Robert. This new set-up is very much a family affair as June&#x2019;s husband Robert just happens to be George&#x2019;s brother: the two sisters are married to two brothers. At first both families seem to be settling in well, sharing delicious meals and having&nbsp;fun times together. Their grown-up children, Hugh and Corinna, visit from London and there even seems to be a hint of romance in the air for them, while the surviving grandparents from both sides of the family move into the big house and forge new friendships.

The main anti-democratic regimes - communist, fascist, Nazi - have disappeared, and new democracies are emerging vigorously or tentatively throughout the world. In this book, one of the most prominent political theorists of our time provides a primer on democracy that clarifies what it is, why it is valuable, how it works, and what challenges it confronts in the future.</p><p><i>"Democracy has been discussed off and on for about twenty-five hundred years, enough time to provide a tidy set of ideas about democracy on which everyone, or nearly everyone, could agree.

Dahl's <i>On Democracy</i> is rather tidy, indeed. Dahl, an emeritus professor of political science at Yale, covers questions like "Where and how did democracy develop?" in accessible--almost chatty--prose, often taking the time to say a few "words about words," in which he examines, for example, the historical connotations of "democracy" and "republic" (it turns out that until James Madison declared there was a political distinction to be made, the only difference between the two was their etymological roots). Experienced readers may find their eyes glazing over at pronouncements such as "Democratic institutions are less likely to develop in a country subject to intervention by another country hostile to democracy in that country," but if you're looking for a comprehensive yet brief overview of how democracy works, <i>On Democracy</i> fits the bill.</p>In this accessible and authoritative book, an eminent political theorist provides a primer on democracy that clarifies what it is, why it is valuable, how it works, and what challenges it confronts in the future.&#34;Dahl, this country&#39;s leading student of democratic theory and practice, has written an eloquent and concise summary of the great issues in democratic thought.&#34;-G.

She and her husband, Bruce, are cofounders of Relationship Technologies in New York City.<b>Introduction</b><p>Have no fear, Mama Gena is here! This book is your road map to the heart and soul, the scintillating core, of being a woman. It's the result of twelve years' research into what women want and what makes us happy. It's a how-to guide for living a completely fulfilled life.</p><p>Sounds good, doesn't it?</p><p>The key to this wonderful life is what I call the "womanly arts" -- a set of skills and behaviors that you already know but may have forgotten about. If practiced passionately and enthusiastically, these arts allow every woman to revel in her own fabulousness. They give her the power to create a life of pleasure, abundance, and full gratification.</p><p></p>* * *<p>I want you to start thinking about the life you would have if you could. I want you to envision your own fantasyland. Give free rein to this vision of your desired lifestyle, and don't let it be dominated by someone else's plans for you. Do you see a life that allows for for intimacy, family, responsibility, creativity, great sex, flexible time, and flexible emotions? Do you see days filled with alone time -- or shared activities with a bevy of friends, family, and children? Do you see hours spent volunteering, or making big bucks in a high-powered career, or creating the next great painting or novel? Do you see yourself in a rural place, or by the beach, or up in the mountains, or in a small town, or in a city apartment? Do you see a life spent with one love, or filled with a myriad of interesting and exciting partners?</p><p>Maybe you see yourself picking a bit of this and dash of that. </p><p>Whatever your vision is, however unlikely, unorthodox, or "unacceptable," get ready to run with it. Your feelings are the utmost priority, your desires are more important than anyone else's deadline or mandate.</p><p>A pleasurable life is not a necessity. Not an obligation. We are taught to work hard, study hard, and deprive ourselves. But who teaches us about pleasure? Who teaches us to laugh when we feel like it, to concentrate on how good the sun feels on our skin, to value the giddy pleasure of playing hooky, or to plunge forward enthusiastically and seize our own brass ring? Many of us have almost forgotten a life of pleasure can exist. As a woman, though, pleasure is your birthright. That's the big, fat secret I am here to unlock with you.</p><p>Your dreams, your desires are not too big for you. They are just the right size. And they are rapidly and readily accessible if you follow me through the doorway of pleasure. This doorway has always been there -- Mama is just reminding you where the key is and giving you a little shove toward happiness and success, however you define them. I am here to tell you that every woman can be creative, sexy, and happy and can have a marvelous relationship with a life partner. Glamour and beauty are within reach. And ecstasy, pleasure, and fun can play a huge role in your life.</p><p>In working with countless women as a facilitator and researcher in the area of relationships, I have discovered that a woman's pleasure has an electrifying effect on herself and others. If a woman even begins to think about what pleasures her, she instantly feels pleasured. And if that woman can communicate those delicious thoughts to someone else, that lucky person also feels the glow. I know, I know, it sounds so simple. But hey, no one is in the habit of looking at the power of pleasure.</p><p>So many people have dedicated themselves to examining women's problems and making much of their general unhappiness. Therapists, weight-loss centers, credit card companies -- everybody's got us in their clutches, and somehow women as a whole aren't too much happier for it. I dedicated so much time to studying women's unhappiness (my own included), and none of it led to fun. Finally I decided to investigate women's pleasure instead. No one else was doing it, really. It was a wide-open field, no competition. Not too many people seemed to have the time or the interest to explore pleasure -- how to attain it and the rewards that come with it. And what I have found has proved to be amazing, beyond anything I could have dreamed. I learned that the pleasure women are capable of -- that energy -- is the greatest untapped natural resource on this planet. I discovered that when a woman is happy and fulfilled, those around her share the rewards. A gratified woman can be the source of a whole community's joy and prosperity.</p><p>That revelation led me to study what I call the womanly arts -- the skills that enable us to access joy, gratification, energy, and fun all day, every day. Here's a rundown:</p><p></p><ul><p></p><li>The first and most important womanly art is the ability to identify your desires. Mama is here to help you locate what you really want and show you how to <i>whet your own appetite.</i> Some women (maybe most women) don't even know what they want. We will coddle your fledgling desires until they sing to you loud and clear.<p></p></li><li>The second womanly art is the art of <i>having fun,</i> no matter where you are. I'll help you figure out a way to have a good time whether you're at the dry cleaner, sitting at your desk, listening to your mother-in-law, or doing your taxes.<p></p></li><li>The third womanly art I'll talk about is the art of <i>sensual pleasure.</i> The orientation to pleasure is a feminine instinct, and each glorious inch of your body is yours to use for your fulfillment. Women have a greater affinity for pleasure -- a drive, an innate understanding of pleasure -- simply because they're women. After all, they have an organ on their body whose sole function is pleasure. You will learn more about your instrument and its potential.<p></p></li><li><i>Flirting</i> is another womanly art. It is a fantastic way to fire up your entire life. When a woman has mastered her ability to flirt, she feels deliciously powerful.<p></p></li><li>When you feel good enough to flirt, you feel good enough to practice the womanly art of <i>owning your beauty.</i> Mama will inspire you to make the decision, every minute of every day, that you are the hottest, most gorgeous thing that ever lived. Why not? You are.<p></p></li><li>I will also encourage you to <i>befriend your inner bitch.</i> Learning to live with her is an art. And as you know, if you're heading into battle you want that bitch on your side! Mama will show you how.<p></p></li><li><i>Owning and operating men</i> is another womanly art. You already knew that. We'll investigate the ways in which a woman's pleasure (namely, yours) can help both of you live happily ever after.<p></p></li><li>And the final womanly art we'll be learning is the art of <i>inviting abundance.</i> Women have uncanny powers of attraction. You'll learn how to conjure up anything you want -- a new coat, a parking space, a new job for your best friend.<p></p></li></ul><p>In this book Mama will articulate all the skills, the opportunities, and the pathways a woman can access to become enthusiastically gratified. Along the way we will explore your deepest intuitions, your desires both great and small, and pleasure -- as experienced by all your five senses. I'll show you the power that comes when you embrace all of your contradictions -- when you let Elegant and Slutty sit side by side, or allow Tacky, Tasteful, Over-the-top, and Understated to appear simultaneously, in the same ball gown. We'll put Shy in her proper place, next to Abandon. We'll invite unabashed Hilarity to disrupt the most refined dinner tables. You'll see Voracious and Virginal are not incompatible. In these pages, Lust is exalted, Repression abhorred. The fragrance of freshly sweaty skin is more divinely valuable than Chanel No. 5.</p><p>You'll soon learn that anything fun is preferable to a dozen obligations, and in my book, a shot of fulfillment is always the next best step. I'll help you realize that there is always time for passion, in any form. And gratitude. Showers of gratitude and thanks are the order of the day.</p><p>To embrace the womanly arts, you must simply begin with a positive point of view. Rely on the fact that something good or something better than good is heading your way at all times. Your manicured hand is in control of your own ecstasy dial. Whatever befalls you, you can and will use it to make yourself happy. In every circumstance you are the one with the edge. You will know that whatever your desires are, they will not just be fulfilled, but bettered and expanded, with frosting on top. Most women spend their time whining about the past rather than paying attention to what they want now. What you will soon see is that ecstasy comes from leaping in the direction of your desires, despite the obstacles. What might surprise you most is that true selfishness can be the path to real generosity.</p><p>We are going to bypass doubt, judgment, and disapproval. We are going to leave the past where it is and enjoy the present even more by focusing on rituals, exercises, and new perspectives that introduce your dreams and your desires right into reality, <i>right now.</i> You are about to be a gratified woman. A gratified woman can have a glorious time washing the dishes, changing a tire, or being ravished in bed. Being on intimate terms with joy, she can create it anywhere. She is not limited by circumstances, money, education, background, or geography. She does not have to find the "right" guy to have a great evening out -- she can draw out the best in any man. She does not need the latest fashion to feel beautiful -- she knows her glow comes from within, no matter what she is wearing.</p><p>A gratified woman is someone who constantly experiences the abundance of life itself and the privilege of life itself because she knows that wherever she is, just by the force of nature that is her being, anything is possible. And that is a wonderful place to be. If you are ready to live in this place, if you are ready for unbridled joy and overflowing passion regardless of life's challenges, turn the page and start the course -- the course of succulence, the course of outrageousness, the course I call Mama Gena's School of Womanly Arts.</p><p>Copyright � 2002 by Regena Thomashauer</p><p></p></p><h2>Introducing Judaism (World Religions)</h2><p><p><em>Introducing Judaism</em> is the ideal starting point for students beginning their studies of this fascinating religion.

Smil argues that no advanced economy can prosper without a strong, innovative manufacturing sector and the jobs it creates. </p><p>Smil explains how manufacturing became a fundamental force behind America's economic, strategic, and social dominance. He describes American manufacturing's rapid rise at the end of the nineteenth century, its consolidation and modernization between the two world wars, its role as an enabler of mass consumption after 1945, and its recent decline. Some economists argue that shipping low-value jobs overseas matters little because the high-value work remains in the United States. But, asks Smil, do we want a society that consists of a small population of workers doing high-value-added work and masses of unemployed? </p><p>Smil assesses various suggestions for solving America's manufacturing crisis, including lowering corporate tax rates, promoting research and development, and improving public education. Will America act to preserve and reinvigorate its manufacturing? It is crucial to our social and economic well-being; but, Smil warns, the odds are no better than even. </p></p><p><p>Vaclav Smil is the author of more than thirty books on energy, the environment, food, and the history of technical advances, including <i>Harvesting the Biosphere: What We Have Taken from Nature</i>, published by the MIT Press.

May I say nothing, my lord?&#x201d; With these words, Oscar Wilde&#x2019;s courtroom trials came to a close. The lord in question, High Court justice Sir Alfred Wills, sent Wilde to the cells, sentenced to two years in prison with hard labor for the crime of &#x201c;gross indecency&#x201d; with other men. As cries of &#x201c;shame&#x201d; emanated from the gallery, the convicted aesthete was roundly silenced.</p><p>But he did not remain so. Behind bars and in the period immediately after his release, Wilde wrote two of his most powerful works&#x2015;the long autobiographical letter <i>De Profundis </i>and an expansive best-selling poem, <i>The Ballad of Reading Gaol</i>. In <i>The Annotated Prison Writings of Oscar Wilde, </i>Nicholas Frankel collects these and other prison writings, accompanied by historical illustrations and his rich facing-page annotations. As Frankel shows, Wilde experienced prison conditions designed to break even the toughest spirit, and yet his writings from this period display an imaginative and verbal brilliance left largely intact. Wilde also remained politically steadfast, determined that his writings should inspire improvements to Victorian England&#x2019;s grotesque regimes of punishment. But while his reformist impulse spoke to his moment, Wilde also wrote for eternity.</p><p>At once a savage indictment of the society that jailed him and a moving testimony to private sufferings, Wilde&#x2019;s prison writings&#x2015;illuminated by Frankel&#x2019;s extensive notes&#x2015;reveal a very different man from the famous dandy and aesthete who shocked and amused the English-speaking world.</p></p><p><p>Nicholas Frankel is Professor of English at Virginia Commonwealth University.</p>&#x201c;A welcome gathering of Wilde&#x2019;s most humane work, with choice illustrations, where the self-proclaimed &#x2018;lord of language&#x2019; gives voice to the poor, the disaffected.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Irish Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Frankel has...done us a favor to annotate such material with such labor and such learning...Wilde comes out of this volume with all his follies flying as an extraordinarily impressive human being.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Peter Craven</b><b>, </b><b><i>Sydney Morning Herald</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;With headlines of police brutality and judicial immorality as relevant today as back then, creative works which remind audiences of Wilde&#x2019;s timeless moral principles remain vital.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>John L.

With remarkable character depth and vivid descriptive passages, The Virginian stands not only as the first great novel of American Western literature, but as a testament to the eternal struggle between good and evil in humanity, and a revealing study of the forces that guide the combatants on both sides. <br> Pocket Books' Enriched Classics present the world's greatest literature enhanced for the contemporary reader.

After roughing it along the way, he settles on Judge Henry's cattle ranch in Wyoming, where the owner makes him his right-hand man. The Virginian is strikingly handsome, twetny-seven years old, and, though unversed in the ways of the world and ignorant as to book learning, he has character and personality that inspire respect from all who know him. He manages to force on a turbulent community his idea of law and order-- "getting the drop" on an enemy, vigilante committees, and lynch law. </p><p>The novel recounts his adventures, including his romantic initiation at the hands of Molly Wood, the Vermont girl who became a western school techer.

He studied under Plato at Athens and taught there (367&#x2013;47); subsequently he spent three years at the court of a former pupil, Hermeias, in Asia Minor and at this time married Pythias, one of Hermeias&#x2019;s relations. After some time at Mitylene, in 343&#x2013;2 he was appointed by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander. After Philip&#x2019;s death in 336, Aristotle became head of his own school (of &#x201c;Peripatetics&#x201d;), the Lyceum at Athens. Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander&#x2019;s death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322.Nearly all the works Aristotle prepared for publication are lost; the priceless ones extant are lecture-materials, notes, and memoranda (some are spurious). They can be categorized as follows:I. Practical: <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>; <i>Great Ethics</i> (<i>Magna Moralia</i>); <i>Eudemian Ethics</i>; <i>Politics</i>; <i>Oeconomica</i> (on the good of the family); <i>Virtues and Vices</i>.<br>II. Logical: <i>Categories</i>; <i>On Interpretation</i>; <i>Analytics</i> (<i>Prior</i> and <i>Posterior</i>); <i>On Sophistical Refutations</i>; <i>Topica</i>.<br>III. Physical: Twenty-six works (some suspect) including astronomy, generation and destruction, the senses, memory, sleep, dreams, life, facts about animals, etc.<br>IV. <i>Metaphysics</i>: on being as being.<br>V. On Art: <i>Art of Rhetoric</i> and <i>Poetics</i>.<br>VI. Other works including the <i>Athenian Constitution</i>; more works also of doubtful authorship.<br>VII.

Several landmark Darger exhibitions and a hit documentary film (<i>In the Realms of the Unreal</i>) have continued to disseminate his work to wider audiences, rendering the persistent epithet of "outsider artist" almost meaningless. All Darger monographs become rarities with incredible rapidity, and this new hardcover edition of the Andrew Edlin Gallery's excellent introduction to Darger will prove no exception. It contains new and improved images, an updated introduction and updated sections on Darger's exhibition history and public collections. In an accompanying essay Edward Madrid G�mez writes: "knowing what we know about this loner's life, it seems that no one else but Darger could have produced it, in the same way that we cannot imagine the ground-breaking works of such artists as Beethoven, Picasso, W�lfli or Joyce emerging from the minds or spirits of anyone else except these geniuses, whose talents have helped define just how far-reaching and accomplished artistic creativity can be."<br><b>Henry Darger</b> was the author of drawings, watercolor scrolls and a 15,000 page novel called <i>The Story of the Vivian Girls, in What Is Known as the Realms of the Unreal, of the Glandeco-Angelinnian War Storm, Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion</i>.</p><p></p><h2>Applied Linear Algebra (Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics)</h2><p><p>This textbook develops the essential tools of linear algebra, with the goal of imparting technique alongside contextual understanding. Applications go hand-in-hand with theory, each reinforcing and explaining the other. This approach encourages students to develop not only the technical proficiency needed to go on to further study, but an appreciation for when, why, and how the tools of linear algebra can be used across modern applied mathematics.</p>Providing an extensive treatment of essential topics such as Gaussian elimination, inner products and norms, and eigenvalues and singular values, this text can be used for an in-depth first course, or an application-driven second course in linear algebra. In this second edition, applications have been updated and expanded to include numerical methods, dynamical systems, data analysis, and signal processing, while the pedagogical flow of the core material has been improved. Throughout, the text emphasizes the conceptual connections between each application and the underlying linear algebraic techniques, thereby enabling students not only to learn how to apply the mathematical tools in routine contexts, but also to understand what is required to adapt to unusual or emerging problems.<p></p><p></p><p>No previous knowledge of linear algebra is needed to approach this text, with single-variable calculus as the only formal prerequisite. However, the reader will need to draw upon some mathematical maturity to engage in the increasing abstraction inherent to the subject. Once equipped with the main tools and concepts from this book, students will be prepared for further study in differential equations, numerical analysis, data science and statistics, and a broad range of applications.

One couple has been the battleground for human relationships and sexual identity. That couple is Adam and Eve. Yet instead of celebrating them, history has blamed them for bringing sin, deceit, and death into the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this fresh retelling of their story, <i>New York Times </i>columnist and PBS host Bruce Feiler travels from the Garden of Eden in Iraq to the Sistine Chapel in Rome, from John Milton&#x2019;s London to Mae West&#x2019;s Hollywood, discovering how Adam and Eve should be hailed as exemplars of a long-term, healthy, resilient relationship. At a time of discord and fear over the strength of our social fabric, Feiler shows how history&#x2019;s first couple can again be role models for unity, forgiveness, and love.<br> &nbsp;<br> Containing all the humor, insight, and wisdom that have endeared Bruce Feiler to readers around the world, <i>The First Love Story </i>is an unforgettable journey that restores Adam and Eve to their rightful place as central figures in our culture's imagination and reminds us that even our most familiar stories still have the ability to surprise, inspire, and guide us today.</p><p>Bruce Feiler writes the &#x201c;This Life&#x201d; column for the Sunday <i>New York Times </i>and is the author of six consecutive <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, including <i>Walking the Bible, Abraham</i> and <i>The Secrets of Happy Families</i>.

He&#x2019;s done a miraculous thing, the literary equivalent of breathing life into a figure made of clay&#x2014;taken a story I&#x2019;ve been hearing since services were held in the old sanctuary and made me experience it again as if for the first time.&#x201d;<b>&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;</b><i>The New York Times Book Review<br><br></i></b>&#x201c;Exhaustively researched, lyrically written.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;<i>Washington Post<br><br></i></b>&#x201c;A fascinating treatise on the impact of Adam and Eve on human thought in the Western world.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;<i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Feiler shows how Adam and Eve have always been and continue to be mutable, rebooted through the ages to suit their times like comic book superheroes. By investigating the history of these re-imaginings, Feiler tracks the evolution of how people have thought about relationships between humanity and God. He focuses on the artists and intellectuals who have subverted mainstream religious dogma and found, in Adam and Eve, radical inspiration for what it means to be human, and what it means to love&#x2014;which are the same thing, really...Feiler&#x2019;s chapters are stuffed with interesting people and concepts. They move briskly, delving into every iconic moment in the first couple&#x2019;s short tale, each an opportunity to examine a different wrinkle of love: collegial, romantic, sexual, familial, extramarital, the blush of youth, the pale of twilight.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Rumpus&nbsp;</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A convincing case that mankind still has much to learn from the first human beings...

The novel has been hailed as one of the most striking early examples of postmodernism and has become a famous test case for theories about reading because of the apparent impossibility of deciding between several radically different interpretations. Does the book have two narrators, as it first appears, or one? How much is fantasy and how much is reality? Whose fantasy and whose reality are they? Brian Boyd, Nabokov's biographer and hitherto the foremost proponent of the idea that <i>Pale Fire</i> has one narrator, John Shade, now rejects this position and presents a new and startlingly different solution that will permanently shift the nature of critical debate on the novel. Boyd argues that the book does indeed have two narrators, Shade and Charles Kinbote, but reveals that Kinbote had some strange and highly surprising help in writing his sections. In light of this interpretation<i>, Pale Fire</i> now looks distinctly less postmodern--and more interesting than ever.</p><br><p> In presenting his arguments, Boyd shows how Nabokov designed <i>Pale Fire</i> for readers to make surprising discoveries on a first reading and even more surprising discoveries on subsequent readings by following carefully prepared clues within the novel. Boyd leads the reader step-by-step through the book, gradually revealing the profound relationship between Nabokov's ethics, aesthetics, epistemology, and metaphysics. If Nabokov has generously planned the novel to be accessible on a first reading and yet to incorporate successive vistas of surprise, Boyd argues, it is because he thinks a deep generosity lies behind the inexhaustibility, complexity, and mystery of the world. Boyd also shows how Nabokov's interest in discovery springs in part from his work as a scientist and scholar, and draws comparisons between the processes of readerly and scientific discovery.</p><br><p> This is a profound, provocative, and compelling reinterpretation of one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century.</p></p><p>Brian Boyd has already chronicled the life of Vladimir Nabokov in two superlative volumes, one devoted to the author's silver-age youth in Russia and the other to his American maturity. Now Boyd turns his attention to the great enchanter's trickiest and most unlikely triumph in <i>Nabokov's Pale Fire</i>. With its oddball structure--which shackles an epic poem in heroic couplets to an increasingly loony, enveloping commentary--this 1962 novel has always been a bone of contention among diehard fans. Some consider it less a work of art than a Rube Goldberg contraption, onto which Nabokov has brilliantly bolted his favorite motifs. Others call <i>Pale Fire</i> the author's true masterpiece, and Brian Boyd falls quite emphatically into the latter camp, arguing that the book is no mere satire on literary parasitism: <blockquote> It is a reflection on the whole history of literature, on the shift from romance to realism, from the old kind of hero with whose glory the reader is invited to identify ... to the modern image of everyman as artist, the suburban Shade, in the modest circumstances of the real, coping with courage and self-control, with imagination, curiosity, tenderness, and kindness, with the fact of his mortality and his losses past and still to come. </blockquote> Boyd's study is at once a shrewd and eloquent guidebook to the intricacies of <i>Pale Fire</i> and a revisionist argument as to its meaning. After all, Nabokovians have spent the last three decades feuding over the ultimate authorship of this double-decker narrative: could the poet, John Shade, have created both the poem <i>and</i> commentary? Or should both be chalked up to that nutty exegete Charles Kinbote? As he wades into this factional war, Boyd can sometimes appear only nominally less insane than Kinbote. ("The prominence of the Shadean or Kinbotean or 'undecidable' readings had not gone unchallenged. D. Barton Johnson, attending to verbal and subverbal detail, stood largely outside the Shade-Kinbote opposition when he focused on the Botkin behind Kinbote." Help!) Yet his hypothesis--which involves a ghost feeding lines to the living like a posthumous Teleprompter--makes perfect sense. And it reminds us that for all Nabokov's vaunted irony and scientific passion, he was fascinated throughout his entire career by the afterlife. Volodya as theologian? Boyd is smart and persuasive enough to make the concept stick, and to send every last one of us back to <i>Pale Fire</i>--immediately. <i>--James Marcus</i><p>"No one knows more about Nabokov and his works than Brian Boyd does, and this book is obviously a work of passion. It enlivens our sense of a marvelous novel, it encourages generous close reading, and it makes the best case possible for the general human value of Nabokov's fiendish cleverness."<b>--Michael Wood, Princeton University, author of <i>The Magician's Doubts: Nabokov and the Risks of Fiction</i></b></p><p>"Brian Boyd is Nabokov's ideal, astute, and observant reader, paying attention to every detail which, for Nabokov, was the essence of all writing and all reading. Boyd does so not only intelligently and thoughtfully but also lovingly."<b>--Galya Diment, University of Washington</b></p><p>"This is a remarkable piece of literary detective work. Brian Boyd brings to bear on Nabokov's most elaborately encrypted novel an acute attention to textual detail and a vast fund of relevant learning, coupled with endlessly resourceful ingenuity. The result is a provocative thesis about the structure and meaning of the novel-seemingly a "solution" but, as he himself grants, really grounds for continuing discussion, and in any case, a vivid demonstration of the excitements of skilled reading."<b>--Robert Alter, University of California, Berkeley</b></p></p><h2>Leading at The Edge: Leadership Lessons from the Extraordinary Saga of Shackleton&#39;s Antarctic Expedition</h2><p>Drawing on the amazing story of a polar exploration team&#x2019;s survival against all odds, author Dennis N.

Morgan when he arranged his first major mountain climb&#x2014;of Mt.Kilimanjaro, Africa&#x2019;s highest and fiercest mountain. He was no professional climber, nor was he in any kind of shape to be tackling any major peak. To the trained mountaineer, Parfet would have seemed foolhardy. But in just four years, with perseverance and unbelievable courage, he managed to successfully complete his quest to scale all Seven Summits, including Kilimanjaro, Aconcagua, Denali, Vinson Massif, Elbrus, Carstenz Pyramid, Kosciusko, and Everest&#x2014;the highest peaks on the seven continents&#x2014;defying all odds and cheating death at every turn. </p> <p> </p> <p> Combining the gripping narrative of Into Thin Air with the adrenaline-fueled drama of Vertical Limit, Die Trying is the incredible story of one man&#x2019;s battle against his own limitations. From dodging avalanches to crossing a ladder over a seemingly bottomless crevasse, to making his way through the Khumbu Icefall and burying a dead teammate at 27, 000 feet, we experience all of the author&#x2019;s exhilarating, often terrifying climbs first-hand. We share the terror of his confrontations with corrupt army officials, cannibalistic tribesmen, and local militia groups, and we follow this ultimate everyman blessed with the opportunity to undertake an extraordinary journey of exploration and self-discovery as he survives on a diet of fried bats and rats in New Guinea and nearly dies after falling into a crevasse when the ground beneath him gave way on Mt. Cook. Recounting such life-on-the-line experiences as almost drowning in crocodile-infested rapids during a canoe race in Belize to pushing himself to the brink of starvation and complete physical exhaustion, Die Trying is a compilation of extraordinary experiences&#x2014;each one a totally unique, self-contained story&#x2014;that illustrate not only the complexity of Bo&#x2019;s amazing vision and ability to extract the possible from the seemingly impossible, but also the all-too-human struggles that we all share. Enlightening and gripping, Die Trying is the compelling story of man&#x2019;s quest to conquer nature&#x2014;and his own fears. </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> <p> Bo Parfet was a postgraduate research fellow at the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and an investment banking analyst for J.P.

Indeed, Lincoln's record on the Constitution and individual rights has fueled a century of debate, from charges that Democrats were singled out for harrassment to Gore Vidal's depiction of Lincoln as an "absolute dictator." Now, in the Pulitzer Prize-winning <em>The Fate of Liberty</em>, one of America's leading authorities on Lincoln wades straight into this controversy, showing just who was jailed and why, even as he explores the whole range of Lincoln's constitutional policies.<br> Mark Neely depicts Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus as a well-intentioned attempt to deal with a floodtide of unforeseen events: the threat to Washington as Maryland flirted with secession, disintegrating public order in the border states, corruption among military contractors, the occupation of hostile Confederate territory, contraband trade with the South, and the outcry against the first draft in U.S. history. Drawing on letters from prisoners, records of military courts and federal prisons, memoirs, and federal archives, he paints a vivid picture of how Lincoln responded to these problems, how his policies were actually executed, and the virulent political debates that followed. Lincoln emerges from this account with this legendary statesmanship intact--mindful of political realities and prone to temper the sentences of military courts, concerned not with persecuting his opponents but with prosecuting the war efficiently. In addition, Neely explores the abuses of power under the regime of martial law: the routine torture of suspected deserters, widespread antisemitism among Union generals and officials, the common practice of seizing civilian hostages. He finds that though the system of military justice was flawed, it suffered less from merciless zeal, or political partisanship, than from inefficiency and the friction and complexities of modern war.<br> Informed by a deep understanding of a unique period in American history, this incisive book takes a comprehensive look at the issues of civil liberties during Lincoln's administration, placing them firmly in the political context of the time. Written with keen insight and an intimate grasp of the original sources, <em>The Fate of Liberty</em> offers a vivid picture of the crises and chaos of a nation at war with itself, changing our understanding of this president and his most controversial policies.<br></p><p><br><strong>Mark E.

An important contribution that will serve the undergraduate as well as [the] scholar."--Professor Dennis M. Shannon, Alabama University--Montgomery<p></p><br>"Excellent book--very informative, and appropriate for today's times as well as for the last century. I think it 'must' reading for students taking a course on the Civil War, and it would be apprpriate reading for several other courses."--Robert Langran, Villanova University<p></p><br>"In this Pulitzer Prize-winning study, Mark Neely makes a major contribution to th[e] revision of the analysis of the nature of war behind the lines....A refreshing historical revision of the inner workings of the Union effort, which all too often is presented as if it had been a well-oiled machine....It is to be hoped that this book will stimulate others to look at the impact of the war on civilians in more detailled ways."--Michael Fellman, <em>Canadian Review of American Studies</em><p></p><br>"At last, some 125 years after the end of the Civil War, we have a more accurate and honest understanding of the Lincoln administration and civil liberties. After years of painstaking archival research Mark Neely presents a compelling argument that history should be left to those who do research and not to novelists, literary critics, or thos with political axes to grind, like the 'lost cause' partisan who wrote <em>American Bastile</em>. Neely's book, which is the best scholarly examination of this issue ever written, will rehabilitate Lincoln's reputation on civil liberties....Extremely convincing."--Paul Finkleman, <em>The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography</em><p></p><br>"By far the best book on the subject....Masterful."--Gabor S. Boritt, <em>Illinois Issues</em><p></p><br>"Intriguing....Neely has refined the debate with exhaustive and impressive research. He has supplied detail and restored context to discussions of civil liberties during the Civil War. His questions are good ones. His answers are striking....The first book-length study of civil liberties during the Lincoln administrations. It will set a standard."--Francis N. Stites, <em>Civil War History</em><p></p><br>"A thorough and meticulously documented study....Highlighted by more than thirty pages of well-researched endnotes, a comprehensive index, and an index of 'prisoners of state.' Highly recommended."--<em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"An in-depth summary of how Lincoln and his administration handled civil rights in the deepest crisis the nation has ever endured....A chilling reminder that personal liberty always hangs in tremulous balance when the nation is tangled in desperate crisis."--<em>The Grand Rapids Press</em><p></p><br>"An important book....[Neely's] research is broad and deep, not only in range of the usual primary materials but in a massive amount of sources in the National Archives on specific cases, hitherto unused."--<em>Indiana Magazine of History</em><p></p><br>"[An] excellent study of civil liberties in the North during the Civil War....Neely writes in clear, straightforward prose....An impressive and valuable addition to the literature of the Civil War."--<em>The Journal of American History</em><p></p><br>"Neely's welcome book on civil liberties under Lincoln advances us beyond this sketchy profile to detail the workings of Lincoln's internal security system Neely reviews voluminous military court and federal prison records that have not heretofore received systematic attention, encompasses the perspectives of president and cabinet as well as those of hundreds of officials in the field, and refines the terminology and conclusions of the old authority, James G. Randall's <em>Constitutional Problems Under Lincoln</em> (1926). The result is a balanced and compelling account that fully acknowledges and explores repressive practices, but repeatedly emphasizes the limits observed by Lincoln and the wartime bureaucracy."--<em>American Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"Throroughly researched and well written--the best treatment by far of the subject."--Norman B.

Author Bio</p> <p>II. Author Letter</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <b> <p>I. Author Bio</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </b> Brian Fagan is one of the leading archaeological writers in the world and an internationally recognized authority on world prehistory. He studied archaeology and anthropology at Pembroke College, Cambridge University, and then spent seven years in sub-Saharan Africa working in museums and in monument conservation and excavating early farming sites in Zambia and East Africa. He was one of the pioneers of multidisciplinary African history in the 1960s. From 1967 to 2003, he was professor of anthropology at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he specialized in lecturing and writing about archaeology to wide audiences. He is now professor emeritus. <p> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Professor Fagan has written six best-selling textbooks: <i>Ancient Lives</i>: <i>An Introduction to Archaeology and Prehistory</i>; <i>In <i>the </i> </i> <i>Beginning</i>; <i>Archaeology: A Brief Introduction</i>; <i>People of the Earth</i>; <i>World Preh</i> <i>istory</i>; and <i>A Brief History of Archaeology</i>&#x2013;all published by Prentice Hall&#x2013;which are used around the world. His general books include <i>The Rape of the Nile</i>, a classic history of Egyptology; <i>The Adventure of Archaeology</i>; <i>Time Detectives</i>; <i>Ancient North America</i>; <i>The Little Ice Age</i>; and <i>The Great Warming.</i> He is general editor of the <i>Oxford Companion to Archaeology</i>. In addition, he has published several scholarly monographs on African archaeology and numerous specialized articles in national and international journals. He is also an expert on multimedia teaching and received the Society for American Archaeology&#x2019;s first Public Education Award for his indefatigable efforts on behalf of archaeology and education.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <b> <p>II. Author Letter</p> </b><p><b> </b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Dear Colleague:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I became an archaeologist by accident, in large part because of the stories told by my very first university instructor, Miles Burkitt. Miles was an institution at Cambridge University where I studied archaeology. His lectures were long on artifacts and short on sophistication. But he was a consummate storyteller&#x2014;about fellow archaeologists and copying Stone Age cave art with the legendary French prehistorian Abb� Breul before World War I, among other things. He taught me that storytelling is central to good teaching.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I started teaching introductory archaeology at the University of California - Santa Barbara in 1967, to an audience of 300 students. Finding no suitable textbooks, I ended up writing <i>Ancient Lives;</i> a short book that combined both the basics of method and theory&#x2014;how archaeology works&#x2014;and the major developments of world prehistory. It has filled an important niche in the marketplace for instructors who want a course that combines the basics both of archaeology itself and of human prehistory. To my delight, it has been widely used in many colleges and universities as a first introduction to a complex subject that has an important role to play in today&#x2019;s world. I&#x2019;m proud that highly respected archaeologists first encountered archaeology through its pages!</p> <i> <p>&nbsp;</p> </i><p><i>Ancient Lives </i>is a straightforward journey through the world of archaeology and prehistory, which covers the basics--I mean the basics. Its chapters answer fundamental questions. How do we find sites, excavate them, and analyze their finds? How do we date the past? How do we study ancient landscapes and settlement patterns? It also tells the story of the human past from the emergence of the first humans in East Africa well before 2.5 million years ago to the appearance of the world&#x2019;s first pre-industrial civilizations in 3100 B.C. and afterward. It surveys the long span of human experience in the Old World, also in the Americas, attempting to tell the story of our remote past as a straightforward narrative, not just a list of artifacts and archaeological sites. <i>Ancient Lives</i> is user friendly, as jargon-free as possible, and designed for complete beginners. It can serve either as a one-shot introduction to the subject as part of general education, or a basis for taking additional courses later on. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This new fifth edition draws on the success of earlier editions, and plentiful encouragement from users and reviewers, as well as students. The basic approach is unchanged: produce a simple narrative of method and theory and human prehistory for beginners. I&#x2019;ve updated examples throughout, added new information on human evolution, and brought in some exciting new discoveries, such as the G�bekli carvings in Turkey and the Lords of Sic�n from coastal Peru. The illustrations have been completely refreshed and revised for this edition. Otherwise, this updated and improved edition continues a successful formula that has introduced thousands of students to the fascinating world of archaeology. Long may it continue to do so!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Please do let me know what you think of the new edition of<i> Ancient Lives</i>.

Along this perilous journey, the magical puppet learns how much turmoil, heart, and hard work it takes to become a &#x201c;real boy.&#x201d; With a nose that grows larger with each lie he tells, Pinocchio has become an enduring icon in children&#x2019;s literature, and now his story is brilliantly reimagined in this stunning gift edition. </p><p><em>The Adventures of Pinocchio</em> includes specially commissioned artwork and exclusive interactive features, including:</p><ul><li>A Pinocchio puppet with clothing</li><li>Additional finger puppets</li><li>A small theatre for a puppet show</li><li>A court deck with Pinocchio behind sliding bars</li><li>A fold out shark revealing Pinocchio and Geppetto inside</li></ul><p>This wondrous edition will enchant readers of every age an become a treasured keepsake passed down for generations.</p><p></p></p><p><p>Carlo Collodi is the pen name of Italian author Carlo Lorenzini, creator of the beloved children&#x2019;s character, Pinocchio. A Tuscan who fought in Italy&#x2019;s wars of unification, Collodi was already a famous novelist and popular translator of French fairy tales when he began to contribute chapters in the life of a marionette to Italy&#x2019;s first newspaper for children, <em>Il Giornale per i Bambini</em>. The adventures of the disobedient puppet were an immediate success and Pinocchio&#x2019;s story has been translated and adapted numerous times, including the classic 1940 animated production from Walt Disney. Collodi died in 1890.</p></p><h2>A Farm Through Time</h2><p>This text presents the history of a farm from medieval times to the present day.

Patients called him the "doctor with the rose." He made them smile by pinning a flower from bedside bouquets on his lab coat.</p> <p>Madge, however, needed more than a smile. The automobile accident had left her leg nearly severed at the knee. She was young, beautiful, and very much afraid. When Joe spotted her in the ER, he did something he&#x2019;d never done before.</p> <p>Joe took his lab coat, bejeweled with the rose, and placed it gently over the young woman. As she was wheeled into the operating room, the coat was removed, but she asked to keep the flower. When she awoke from surgery, it was still in her hand. </p> <p>When I tell you that Madge never forgot Joe, you won&#x2019;t be surprised. When I tell you how she thanked him, you very well may be.</p> <p>But before we finish the story of Joe&#x2019;s cloak, could I ask you to think about your own? Do you own a cloak of love? Do you know anyone who needs one? When you cover someone with concern, you are fulfilling what Paul had in mind when he wrote the phrase "love . . . always protects" (1 Cor. 13:4&#x2013;7 niv). </p> <p>Paul employed a rich word here. Its root meaning is "to cover or conceal." Its cousins on the noun side of the family are <i>roof</i> and <i>shelter.</i> When Paul said, "Love always protects," he might have been thinking of the shade of a tree or the refuge of a house. He might even have been thinking of a coat. One scholar thinks he was. The <i>Theological Dictionary of the New Testament</i> is known for its word study, not its poetry. But the scholar sounds poetic as he explains the meaning of <i>protect</i> as used in 1 Corinthians 13:7. The word conveys, he says, "the idea of covering with a cloak of love."1</p> <p>Remember receiving one? You were nervous about the test, but the teacher stayed late to help you. You were far from home and afraid, but your mother phoned to comfort you. You were innocent and accused, so your friend stood to defend you. Covered with encouragement. Covered with tender-hearted care. Covered with protection. <i>Covered with a cloak of love.</i></p> <p>Your finest cloak of love, however, came from God. Never thought of your Creator as a clothier? Adam and Eve did. </p> <p>Every clothing store in the world owes its existence to Adam and Eve. Ironing boards, closets, hangers&#x2014;all trace their ancestry back to the Garden of Eden. Before Adam and Eve sinned, they needed no clothing; after they sinned, they couldn&#x2019;t get dressed fast enough. They hid in the bushes and set about the task of making a wardrobe out of fig leaves.</p> <p>They craved protection. Well they should have. They knew the consequences of their mistake. God had warned them, "You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden. You must not even touch it, or you will die" (Gen. 3:3). </p> <p>Of course the one tree they were told not to touch was the one they couldn&#x2019;t resist, and the fruit of the tree became a doorknob that, once pulled, permitted a slew of unwanted consequences to enter. </p> <p>One of which was shame. Adam and Eve had felt no shame. Then they felt nothing but. Hence they hid, and hence they sewed, but the covering was insufficient. What is a grove of trees to the eyes of God? What protection is found in a fig leaf? </p> <p>Adam and Eve found themselves, like Madge, vulnerable on a gurney&#x2014;wounded, not by a car, but by their own sin.</p> <p>But what would God do? Had he not announced his judgment? Hadn&#x2019;t his law been broken? Didn&#x2019;t justice demand their death? Is he not righteous?</p> <p>But, we are quick to counter, is God not love? And weren&#x2019;t Adam and Eve his children? Could his mercy override his justice? Is there some way that righteousness can coexist with kindness? </p> <p>According to Genesis 3:21 it can. The verse has been called the first gospel sermon. Preached not by preachers, but by God himself. Not with words, but with symbol and action. You want to see how God responds to our sin? </p> <p>"The Lord God made clothes from animal skins for the man and his wife and dressed them" (Gen. 3:21). </p> <p>The mystery behind those words! Read them again, and try to envision the moment. </p> <p>"The Lord God made clothes from animal skins for the man and his wife and dressed them." </p> <p>That simple sentence suggests three powerful scenes. </p> <p>Scene 1: God slays an animal. For the first time in the history of the earth, dirt is stained with blood. Innocent blood. The beast committed no sin. The creature did not deserve to die. </p> <p>Adam and Eve did. The couple deserve to die, but they live. The animal deserves to live, but it dies. In scene 1, innocent blood is shed.</p> <p>Scene 2: Clothing is made. The shaper of the stars now becomes a tailor. </p> <p>And in Scene 3: God dresses them. "The Lord . . . dressed them."</p> <p>Oh, for a glimpse of that moment. Adam and Eve are on their way out of the garden. They&#x2019;ve been told to leave, but now God tells them to stop. "Those fig leaves," he says, shaking his head, "will never do." And he produces some clothing. But he doesn&#x2019;t throw the garments at their feet and tell them to get dressed. He dresses them himself. "Hold still, Adam. Let&#x2019;s see how this fits." As a mother would dress a toddler. As a father would zip up the jacket of a preschooler. As a physician would place a lab coat over a frightened girl. God covers them. He protects them.</p> <p>Love always protects. </p> <p>Hasn&#x2019;t he done the same for us? We eat our share of forbidden fruit. We say what we shouldn&#x2019;t say. Go where we shouldn&#x2019;t go. Pluck fruit from trees we shouldn&#x2019;t touch.</p> <p>And when we do, the door opens, and the shame tumbles in. And we hide. We sew fig leaves. Flimsy excuses. See-through justifications. We cover ourselves in good works and good deeds, but one gust of the wind of truth, and we are naked again&#x2014;stark naked in our own failure. </p> <p>So what does God do? Exactly what he did for our parents in the garden. He sheds innocent blood. He offers the life of his Son. And from the scene of the sacrifice the Father takes a robe&#x2014;not the skin of an animal&#x2014;but the robe of righteousness. And does he throw it in our direction and tell us to shape up? No, he dresses us himself. He dresses us <i>with</i> himself. "You were all baptized into Christ, and so you were all clothed with Christ" (Gal. 3:26&#x2013;27). </p> <p>The robing is his work, not ours. Did you note the inactivity of Adam and Eve? They did nothing. Absolutely nothing. They didn&#x2019;t request the sacrifice; they didn&#x2019;t think of the sacrifice; they didn&#x2019;t even dress themselves. They were passive in the process. So are we. "You have been saved by grace through believing. You did not save yourselves; it was a gift from God. It was not the result of your own efforts, so you cannot brag about it. God has made us what we are" (Eph. 2:8&#x2013;10).</p> <p>We hide. He seeks. We bring sin. He brings a sacrifice. We try fig leaves. He brings the robe of righteousness. And we are left to sing the song of the prophet: "He has covered me with clothes of salvation and wrapped me with a coat of goodness, like a bridegroom dressed for his wedding, like a bride dressed in jewels" (Isa. 61:10). </p> <p>God has clothed us. He protects us with a cloak of love. Can you look back over your life and see instances of God&#x2019;s protection? I can too. My junior year in college I was fascinated by a movement of Christians several thousand miles from my campus. Some of my friends decided to spend the summer at the movement&#x2019;s largest church and be discipled. When I tried to do the same, every door closed. Problem after problem with finances, logistics, and travel.</p> <p>A second opportunity surfaced: spending a summer in Brazil. In this case, every door I knocked on swung open. Two and one half decades later I see how God protected me. The movement has become a cult&#x2014;dangerous and oppressive. Time in Brazil introduced me to grace&#x2014;freeing and joyful. Did God protect me? Does God protect us? </p> <p>Does he do for us what he did for the woman caught in adultery? He protected her from the stones. And his disciples? He protected them from the storm. And the demoniac? He protected him from hell itself. Why, Jesus even protected Peter from the tax collectors by providing a tax payment.</p> <p>And you? Did he keep you from a bad relationship? Protect you from the wrong job? Insulate you from _______________ (you fill in the blank)? "Like hovering birds, so will [the Lord Almighty] protect Jerusalem" (Isa. 31:5 jb). "He will strengthen and protect you" (2 Thess. 3:3 niv). "He will command his angels . . . to guard you" (Ps. 91:11 niv). God protects you with a cloak of love.</p> <p>Wouldn&#x2019;t you love to do the same for him? What if you were given the privilege of Mary? What if God himself were placed in your arms as a naked baby? Would you not do what she did? "She wrapped the baby with pieces of cloth" (Luke 2:7).</p> <p>The baby Jesus, still wet from the womb, was cold and chilled. So this mother did what any mother would do; she did what love does: She covered him. </p> <p>Three decades later another lover of Christ did the same. This time the body of Jesus wasn&#x2019;t cold from the chill; it was cold from death. Joseph of Arimathea had it lowered from the cross. Just as Mary cleansed the child from the womb, Joseph prepared the Savior for the tomb. He washed the spit from the face and sponged the blood from the beard. "Then Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth" (Matt. 27:59). </p> <p>Mary dressed the baby. Joseph cleansed the body.</p> <p>Wouldn&#x2019;t you cherish an opportunity to do the same? You have one. Such opportunities come your way every day. Jesus said, </p> <p>I was without clothes, and you gave me something to wear." . . .</p> <p>When," [the people asked,] "did we see you without clothes and give you something to wear?" . . . </p> <p>I tell you the truth, anything you did for even the least of my people here, you also did for me." (Matt. 25:36, 38, 40) </p> <p>Do you know anyone, like Madge, who is wounded and afraid? Do you know anyone, like Adam and Eve, who is guilty and embarrassed? Do you know anyone who needs a cloak of love? </p> <p>Have you ever had a teenager in trouble? You hear the garage door open after the curfew hour. You climb out of bed and march to the kitchen, and there you find him at the counter. The smell of beer is on his breath. The flush of alcohol is on his cheeks. This is serious. He has been drinking. He has been driving. You have a problem, and I have a question. What are you going to give your son?</p> <p>Are you going to give him a lecture? He deserves one. Are you going to give him three months with no keys? That may be wise. Are you going to give him a life sentence with no parole? That may be understandable, considering your worry&#x2014;but don&#x2019;t forget to give your child a cloak of love. At some point over the next few hours he desperately needs to feel your arm around his shoulders. He needs to be cloaked, covered, blanketed in your love. Love always protects. </p> <p>Know anyone who needs a cloak of love?</p> <p>Have you ever heard anyone gossip about someone you know? Ever seen human jackals make a meal out of a fallen friend? "Well, I heard that she . . ." "Oh, but didn&#x2019;t you know that she . . ." "Let me tell you what a friend told me about him . . ." Then all of a sudden it&#x2019;s your turn. Everybody is picking your friend apart. What do you have to say?</p> <p>Here is what love says: Love says nothing. Love stays silent. "Love covers a multitude of sins" (1 Pet. 4:8 nasb). Love doesn&#x2019;t expose. It doesn&#x2019;t gossip. If love says anything, love speaks words of defense. Words of kindness. Words of protection. </p> <p>Know anyone in need of a cloak of love? </p> <p>A few years back I offered one to my daughters. The whirlwind of adolescence was making regular runs through our house, bringing with it more than our share of doubts, pimples, and peer pressure. I couldn&#x2019;t protect the girls from the winds, but I could give them an anchor to hold in the midst. On Valentine&#x2019;s Day, 1997, I wrote the following and had it framed for each daughter: </p> <p>I have a special gift for you. My gift is warmth at night and sunlit afternoons, chuckles and giggles and happy Saturdays.</p> <p>But how do I give this gift? Is there a store which sells laughter? A catalog that offers kisses? No. Such a treasure can&#x2019;t be bought. But it can be given. And here is how I give it to you. </p> <p>Your Valentine&#x2019;s Day gift is a promise, a promise that I will always love your mother. With God as my helper, I will never leave her. You&#x2019;ll never come home to find me gone. You&#x2019;ll never wake up and find that I have run away. You&#x2019;ll always have two parents. I will love your mother. I will honor your mother. I will cherish your mother. That is my promise. That is my gift.</p> <p>Love, Dad</p> <p>Know anyone who could use some protection? Of course you do. Then give some.</p> <p>Pay a gas bill for a struggling elderly couple.</p> <p>Promise your kids that, God being your helper, they&#x2019;ll never know a hungry day or a homeless night. </p> <p>Tell your husband that you&#x2019;d do it all over again and invite him on a honeymoon. </p> <p>Make sure your divorced friends are invited to your parties. </p> <p>And when you see a wounded soul, shivering and shaken on a gurney of life, offer a lab coat and leave the rose.</p> <p>That&#x2019;s what Dr. Wise did. And he didn&#x2019;t stop there. As Madge recovered, he paid visits to her room. Many visits. When he learned that she was engaged, he hung a "No Visitors" sign on her door so her fianc� couldn&#x2019;t enter. Madge didn&#x2019;t object. Her diary reads, "I hope that handsome young doctor comes by to visit today." He did, that day and many others, always with a rose. One a day until she was dismissed from the hospital. </p> <p>And Madge never forgot. Her response? She gave him a rose in return. The next day she gave another. Then the next, another. As they started dating, the daily roses still came. When they married, she didn&#x2019;t stop giving them. Madge convinced the Colonial Golf Course across the street from her house to plant roses so she could give the doctor his daily gift. For nearly forty years, every day&#x2014;a rose. Their younger son, Harold, says he can&#x2019;t remember a time when there wasn&#x2019;t a glass in the refrigerator containing roses for his dad.3 </p> <p>A cloak of love. A rose of gratitude. </p> <p>Have you been given the first?

Acknowledging the natural material bases of human life, Santayana traces the development of the human capacity for appreciating and cultivating ideals. It is a capacity he exhibits as he articulates a continuity running through animal impulse, practical intelligence, and ideal harmony in reason, society, art, religion, and science. The work is an exquisitely rendered vision of human life lived sanely.</p><p>In this fifth book, Santayana concludes his monumental work with a defense of science and a critique of major rivals to the cognitive ascendancy of science. Indeed, Santayana writes that science crowns the &#x201c;whole life of Reason.&#x201d; He finds two kinds of science, physics and dialectic; considers the role of history; examines the mechanisms of nature; defends scientific psychology; discusses pre-rational morality, rational ethics, and post-rational morality; and argues that science contains all trustworthy knowledge.</p><p>This Critical Edition, volume VII of <i>The Works of George Santayana</i>, includes notes, textual commentary, lists of variants and emendations, an index, and other tools useful to Santayana scholars.

If you take the time to read only one professional book, make it this book." -W. H. Inmon<br> <br> One of the most dramatic new developments in database design, the dimensional data warehouse is a powerful database model that.significantly enhances managers' ability to quickly analyze large, multidimensional data sets. Written by the leading proponent of this revolutionary new approach, this valuable book/CD toolkit outfits you with all the nuts-and-bolts information you need to design, build, manage, and use dimensional data warehouses for virtually any type of business application, as well as software for querying dimensional data warehouses.<br> <br> Employing many real-life case studies of data warehouses, Ralph Kimball provides clear-cut guidelines on how to model data and design data warehouses to support advanced multidimensional decision support systems. Beginning with the relatively simple example of a data warehouse for a grocery store, he progresses, step-by-step, through an increasingly complex array of business applications in retail, manufacturing, banking, insurance, subscriptions, and airline reservations. By the end of the book, you will have mastered the full range of powerful techniques for creating, controlling, and navigating dimensional business databases that are easy to understand and navigate.<br> <br> On the CD-ROM you'll find:<br> * Software for querying dimensional data warehouses.<br> * Working models of all the databases described in the book.</p><p>Ralph Kimball's <i>The Data Warehouse Toolkit</i> translates the author's extensive real-world design experience into a truly useful guide to building data warehouses for today's corporations. Written in a no-nonsense prose style, the author gives developers and managers the basics of designing, building, and running data warehouses that are effective and useful to upper management.<p> This book begins with the fundamentals of what data warehouses are and how they differ from traditional databases used in online transaction processing (OLTP). (Basically, data warehouses look at trends in millions of database records drawn from across organizations.) Once the author establishes this foundation, he solidly introduces the issues of data-warehouse design, using samples drawn from a wide variety of industries, including grocery stores, inventory warehouses, shipping, financial services, cable TV subscriptions, insurance, and travel. The author succinctly describes the relevant "dimensions" of each industry. (These are the values or features that management will most likely want to track for each industry. The data warehouse must be prepared to answer these "questions.")</p><p> The last section of the book covers the process of actually designing a data warehouse, from conducting user interviews to planning for the hardware needed to run a data warehouse (where databases easily run in gigabytes and include millions of records). This text also includes a discussion of how to create effective front ends for users (which will report the results of data-warehouse queries).</p><p> For its scope and intelligence, <i>The Data Warehouse Toolkit</i> is required reading for any developer or manager who wants to get a perspective on data warehouses before building one. <i>--Richard Dragan</i></p>This definitive guide succinctly explains how to build a data warehouse by using actual case studies of existing data warehouses developed for specific types of business applications such as retail, manufacturing, banking, insurance, subcriptions and airline reservations. Describes a powerful new model of data warehouse design, the dimensional data warehouse, that provides readers with the ability to quickly analyze complex information in order to make sound decisions. The accompanying CD-ROM includes a toolkit for building dimensional data warehouses and examples of all the databases discussed in the text.</p><h2>Iron John: A Book about Men</h2><p><b>The 25th anniversary edition of the groundbreaking <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, with a new afterword by the author--which offers a new vision of what it is to be a man</b><br>In this timeless and deeply learned classic, poet and translator Robert Bly offers nothing less than a new vision of what it means to be a man.<br><br> Bly's vision is based on his ongoing work with men, as well as on reflections on his own life. He addresses the devastating effects of remote fathers and mourns the disappearance of male initiation rites in our culture. Finding rich meaning in ancient stories and legends, Bly uses the Grimm fairy tale "Iron John"-in which a mentor or "Wild Man" guides a young man through eight stages of male growth-to remind us of ways of knowing long forgotten, images of deep and vigorous masculinity centered in feeling and protective of the young.<br><br> At once down-to-earth and elevated, combining the grandeur of myth with the practical and often painful lessons of our own histories, <i>Iron John</i> is an astonishing work that will continue to guide and inspire men-and women-for years to come.</p><p><b>Robert Bly</b> is a poet, author, translator, activist, and leader of the mythopoetic men's movement.

Among the many effects of this cataclysmic movement of people and institutions was the intermixture of cultures in the colonies that Europeans created. <i>Protestant Empire</i> is the first comprehensive survey of the dramatic clash of peoples and beliefs that emerged in the diverse religious world of the British Atlantic, including England, Scotland, Ireland, parts of North and South America, the Caribbean, and Africa. Beginning with the role religion played in the lives of believers in West Africa, eastern North America, and western Europe around 1500, Carla Gardina Pestana shows how the Protestant Reformation helped to fuel colonial expansion as bitter rivalries prompted a fierce competition for souls.</p><p>The English&#x2014;who were latecomers to the contest for colonies in the Atlantic&#x2014;joined the competition well armed with a newly formulated and heartfelt anti-Catholicism. Despite officially promoting religious homogeneity, the English found it impossible to prevent the conflicts in their homeland from infecting their new colonies. Diversity came early and grew inexorably, as English, Scottish, and Irish Catholics and Protestants confronted one another as well as Native Americans, West Africans, and an increasing variety of other Europeans. Pestana tells an original and compelling story of their interactions as they clung to their old faiths, learned of unfamiliar religions, and forged new ones. In an account that ranges widely through the Atlantic basin and across centuries, this book reveals the creation of a complicated, contested, and closely intertwined world of believers of many traditions.</p></p><p>Carla Gardina Pestana, W. E. Smith Professor of History at Miami University, is the author or editor of several books, including The English Atlantic in an Age of Revolution, 1640-1661.<p>Introduction: Religion in the British Atlantic World</p><p>The expansion of Europe from its peninsula into other parts of the globe was one of the most significant events to shape the modern world. Among the many effects of this cataclysmic movement of people and institutions was the intermixture of cultures that occurred in the colonies that Europeans created. Europeans crossed oceans, encountered native inhabitants, and interacted with them in a myriad of ways. What emerged from these encounters was, as historians James H. Merrell and Colin Calloway have pointed out, a new world for everyone involved. Central to the creation of this new world was a clash of religious beliefs and practices. As a result of cultural encounters, all religions were changed&#x2014;European Christianity no less than Native American spirituality. When Europeans moved out into the Atlantic basin, they brought together the diverse religious traditions and experiences of people from three continents.</p><p>By 1800 Christianity had reached into sub-Saharan Africa, both in the Kongo, where Portuguese Catholics had introduced Catholicism centuries before, and more recently into Sierra Leone, a new colony under British authority peopled by Protestant settlers of African descent who were strongly committed to the Christian faith. Native religions had been reshaped by the introduction of Christianity in vast areas of North and South America. Roman Catholicism had become an indigenous religion over centuries of adaptation in Latin America to the south and in Quebec to the north, while Protestant Christianity had made serious inroads in some communities in the broad central swath of North America. The movement of peoples with their beliefs and practices had spread not just Christianity generally but competing versions of that faith, so that in Anglophone areas of the Atlantic world a variety of Christian faiths flourished and vied for adherents, from Baptists and Methodists to Moravians and Quakers, by 1800. Though Christianity was dominant among the new religions, the other Old World monotheistic faiths&#x2014;Judaism and Islam&#x2014;were also represented in the Atlantic world of 1800, while the traditions of many non-monotheists continued to be practiced, whether by enslaved Africans or native peoples of the Americas.</p><p>Although it made a late and unpromising start in the bid for colonies, England contributed profoundly to the religious history of the North Atlantic. As one of the principle sources of Protestant colonization in the America (along with the Dutch), England was often at odds with the Roman Catholic empires of Spain, France, and Portugal. In the British colonies, a diverse array of Protestant groups, along with a smattering of Catholics, participated&#x2014;from England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, and the northern reaches of western Europe. Native Americans in the mainland colonies and Africans everywhere further complicated the religious assortment. The mixing of peoples that occurred in the English and British colonies was arguably more complicated than in any other colonial setting, with the possible exception of the Dutch. The English failed almost completely in asserting the level of control over religious practice that the Spanish achieved in New Spain. Only weakly establishing the Church of England, they oversaw an increasingly diverse religious landscape. Yet, despite this failure to create a uniformly Anglican Atlantic world under English purview, expansion established a broadly shared culture that united believers from different Protestant churches (and different ethnic and racial backgrounds) into a common Anglophone spiritual orientation. Revolution at the end of the eighteenth century would split the British Atlantic politically but the ties that bound it religiously would remain, shaping faith in Western Europe, parts of West Africa, northern North America, and the Caribbean.</p><p>More than any other cultural practice, religion had a far-reaching impact on the very process of colonization and the world that resulted. Religion fueled expansion, justifying conquest and the authority that was established in the wake of those conquests. To a great extent, it sorted people into migration streams, so that Protestants generally went to the colonies of specific countries, Catholics largely to others. Given the variety of spiritual options available in Protestant Europe, diversity came quickly to those colonies opened to migration from England and the United Provinces. That variety would become their most startling feature and would prompt the eventual separation of church and state in the United States. Although religious liberty had intellectual justifications, drawn from the Enlightenment or older ideas about freedom of conscience, the social reality of a complex and contested religious scene propelled those ideas to the fore. Freedom of religion, though heralded in histories of the United States as one of the great accomplishments of the revolutionary era, was adopted reluctantly by most of those who oversaw colonial expansion in British North America.</p><p>Viewing religion within the framework of the Atlantic highlights a number of significant processes that shaped that history. As with many other works of Atlantic history, this book considers circulation&#x2014;not only the movement of people but also of ideas and the books that carried those ideas. European expansion brought people with their religious ideas and assumptions into contact with others. In turn, this contact prompted innumerable religious encounters, not only among inhabitants from the four continents bordering the Atlantic basin but also among Europeans of different faiths. People moved in every conceivable direction: Africans who converted to Christianity in the Americas traveled widely as sailors, including manning slave ships that transported cargos from West Africa; Native Americans, sometimes kidnapped and sometimes voluntary, were displayed in European capitals, feted in royal courts, and baptized into state churches; Jews who had been driven from Spain settled in the Netherlands where their descendants participated in colonization and founded communities in both Dutch and British outposts. The very act of moving around changed people and their beliefs. Change occurred not only in the places that Europeans went but also in Europe itself, as people came to terms with the existence of the lands, faiths, and cultures that encounter brought together.</p><p>Particularly among the Protestants who play a leading role in the British Atlantic, books that circulated were important carriers of ideas and markers of identity. For Protestant Europeans literacy was seen as fundamental to civility and to one's ability to function successfully as a converted Christian. A believer needed to be conversant with the Bible, and while familiarity with the Good Book was by no means limited to those who were literate, the ability to read was widely perceived as significant&#x2014;by those doing the converting and by converts themselves. This emphasis on literacy affected the way Europeans went about the project of converting those they encountered. It would also provide one reason many masters feared the prospect of slave conversion. On one level, books were commodities that circulated like any other; but they were also repositories for ideas and potential sources of power.</p><p>A second process that shaped the history of religion on this scale is that of transplantation. Early colonizers used the term "plantation" to refer to actual settlements as well as to the process of creating them. The term connoted carefully uprooting and replanting people and institutions in a new setting. Sometimes whole communities were literally transplanted, such as the Baptist church of Swansea in Wales which removed to Plymouth Plantation in the 1660s. On a broader scale, monarchs expected that the religious institutions of their kingdoms would be transplanted to distant colonies, there to bolster state authority just as they did in the Old World. English monarchs not only assumed that planters (as early settlers were frequently called) would introduce Protestant Christianity to far flung Atlantic locations but also that their adherence to England's state church would help to make them loyal and effective representatives of the crown. This initial expectation was based on their observation of Iberian successes as well as on commonly held assumptions about the necessity for religious unity in a political polity, particularly a geographically dispersed polity. Spanish rulers, working from similar assumption about the centrality of Catholicism to their imperial agenda, organized Spain's movement into the New World to achieve a degree of religious uniformity that English monarchs would envy. Having previously banished Muslims and Jews from Spain, they worked from a more homogenous context.</p><p>For the English, this assumption of easily transplanted religious institutions proved not only a chimera but a problematic goal. As much as the common wisdom of the era dictated religious uniformity, England after the Protestant Reformation never achieved the ideal, having always a Catholic minority at the very least with which to contend. With England, Scotland, and Ireland all ruled by the same king from 1603, the religious diversity of that monarch's realm was remarkably complicated. Events of the mid-seventeenth century also drastically increased the complexity and contention of religious landscape under the later Stuart rulers. Diversity within and among kingdoms made the simple transplantation of a uniform religious framework impossible. The unlikelihood of colonies being anymore homogenous than the metropolitan core was exacerbated by the impulse&#x2014;at all levels from rulers to the ordinary prospective colonist&#x2014;that the Atlantic settlements might offer opportunities for the religiously marginal. Diversity at the center&#x2014;remarkable as it gradually became&#x2014;offered only a pale reflection of the multiplicity of religious faiths and practices that eventually characterized life at the margins. The institutional weakness of the Church of England in the colonies, the diversity of Protestant (and other) options everywhere, and the rising commitment to toleration all ensured that any plan to make the state church a central pillar of the British Atlantic was doomed. The planting of religious institutional was never limited to the official faith, but was in fact a process participated in by many of those outside the established church&#x2014;like the Swansea Baptists&#x2014;and even beyond European Christianity. It therefore complicated the religious milieu rather than, as had been anticipated, helping to keep it simple.</p><p>The challenge of transplantation affected ordinary people's ability to carry their faiths and practices with them too. Some of the people in motion were able to travel with their community and its leaders&#x2014;the puritan migrants to New England who included more clergymen per capita than any other English group comes to mind&#x2014;whereas others were cut loose from some or all of their previous relationships. European Catholics, for instance, left their shrines and holy places. For African captives, the religious disruption enslavement entailed arose from leaving behind the small-scale, intimate social landscape in which their beliefs and practices had flourished. For the original residents of the Americas, the arrival of Europeans set into motion massive epidemics and repeated displacement of populations, both of which severed ties spiritually significant communities and locations.</p><p>Even as a religious environment in its entirety proved difficult to transplant, everyone brought their interpretive frameworks, and these frameworks shaped interactions that would take place in colonies and other Atlantic outposts. For the Protestant English majority, their understanding of the purpose and meaning of their move into the wider Atlantic world was molded by their anti-Catholicism. The long and painful sundering of the ties that initially bound Tudor England to Roman Catholicism left a bitter legacy of suspicion and fear among many English Protestants, and this fear was perpetuated by seventeenth-century events such as the Catholic plot to blow up parliament in 1605.</p><p>If antipopery was a uniquely Protestant viewpoint, other interpretive schemes were more widely held. The idea that spiritually powerful beings had to be respected in order for believers to remain safe manifested itself in different ways among those of various traditions; whether it was Christians asking God for forgiveness or Africans honoring spirits of the dead, a common impulse to respect the wishes of the spiritually powerful animated many believers. Another framework involved witchcraft, in which spiritual power could be yielded by an ill-intentioned individual. This understanding often came into play in the context of encounter, such as when native peoples in New France suspected Jesuit missionaries of witchcraft after many of their companions mysteriously died. These interpretive frameworks&#x2014;which touched on many aspects of life&#x2014;were key components of the encounters that occurred in the Atlantic world.</p><p>A final process that characterized the meeting of religions in the British Atlantic was negotiation. Religious encounters involved an ongoing transaction of give and take. As people encountered new ideas and practices and worked to make sense of them in relation to what they already knew, they negotiated between the familiar and the unfamiliar. If the new appeared to have value, it could be incorporated, often creating a hybrid&#x2014;a version that blended elements of two traditions into something new. When Christianity was brought to Europe initially, the process unfolded in this way, so that, for instance, older community celebrations and rituals were subsumed into the Christian calendar. Native Americans who gradually altered the way that they envisioned the afterlife while doing so in the context of their long-held belief system participated in a version of this process. As historian John Thornton has described this development in the African context, they "naturalized" the unfamiliar, making sense of it in terms of the familiar. That concepts and practices from various traditions might be melded into some new whole made sense in the context of the Native American or West African attitudes toward the potential usefulness of new beliefs or practices. Their religious systems tended to be more open to borrowing to create something both new and recognizably old. Even though they too participated in the blending process, European Christians officially rejected it intellectually, assuming that other traditions were by definition incorrect.</p><p>Europeans entering the Atlantic arena in the aftermath of the Protestant Reformation expected to convert the heathens of America, Africa, and the Caribbean to their version of Christianity&#x2014;whether it was Iberian Catholicism, English Protestantism, or another option. They anticipated that a person confronting Christianity would undergo a dramatic and life-changing alteration. Conversion was a concept deeply ingrained in the Christian tradition, and it carried with it certain expectations about how the process would occur. As the word suggests, it was supposed to change the individual completely. When they carried Christianity to new places and e...</p></p><h2>The Environmental Policy Paradox</h2><p><p>Updated in its seventh edition, <em>The Environmental Policy Paradox</em> provides an introduction to the policy-making process in the United States with regard to air, water, land use, agriculture, energy, and waste disposal, while introducing readers to both global and international environmental issues and institutions. The text explains why some environmental ideas shape policy while others do not, and illustrates that even when the best short- and long-term solutions to environmental problems are identified, the task of implementing these solutions is often left undone or is completed too late. Readers are presented with a comprehensive history of the environmental movement paired with the most up-to-date account of environmental policy available today. </p> <p></p><b> <p>New to the Seventh Edition</p></b> <p></p> <ul> <p> </p><li>Covers new topics including fracking, Arctic drilling, the Keystone XL pipeline controversy, GMOs, food security, and the green economy.</li> <p></p></ul> <p></p> <ul> <p> </p><li>Provides expanded information about the subsidy process.</li> <p></p></ul> <p></p> <ul> <p> </p><li>Extends the treatment of land preservation with a discussion of the Land and Water Conservation Fund.</li> <p></p></ul> <p></p> <ul> <p> </p><li>Adds Discussion Questions to the end of each chapter.</li></ul></p><p><p><strong>Zachary A.

Using an overarching theme, paradox, Smith skillfully ties together the whole narrative, from the "big picture" of the eco-system and social-dominant paradigm, to an introduction to the environmental policy process and its institutional framework, and substantive policy chapters covering everything from air pollution to international environmental management. The new discussion questions will prove popular with introductory students.</p><b> </b><p><b>E. Gene Frankland</b>, <i>Ball State University</i></p> <p>The new edition of Zachary Smith&#x2019;s <i>The Environmental Policy Paradox</i> is a masterful compilation of social, economic, legal, and political matters pertaining to environmental policy: important statutes and policies, movement history, deliberations on current issues like the Keystone XL pipeline and the Paris agreement, and more local issues like land use management.

Pearl Harbor. Stalingrad. D-Day. These defining events of the Second World War exemplify both the immense heroism and the grievous costs of global conflict. They are the tense, thrilling moments that had the potential to swing the war in favor of either side and in turn change the course of history. In this gripping new look at the twentieth century's most crucial conflict, historian P. M. H. Bell analyzes twelve unique turning points that determined the character and the ultimate outcome of the Second World War.</p><p>Be they military campaigns, economic actions, or diplomatic summits, Bell's twelve turning points span the full breadth of the war, from the home front to the front line. Many are familiar&#x2014;Barbarossa and Hiroshima among them&#x2014;while sections on war production, the Atlantic convoy system, and the conferences at Tehran and Yalta emphasize the importance of the combatants' actions off the battlefield. Through these keenly narrated episodes, Bell reveals how the Allied and Axis powers achieved their greatest successes and stumbled into their strategic failures, inviting us to think about the Second World War in a fresh, stimulating way. Ultimately, his close study of these dozen turning points reminds us, often terrifyingly, how easily things might have turned out differently.</p></p><p><b>P. M. H. Bell</b> was Reader in history at the University of Liverpool and is the author of many books, including <i>The Origins of the Second World War in Europe</i>. He lives in Surrey, England."The author&#x2019;s greatest virtue [is] his keen and frequently articulated sense that, at any vital moment, things might easily have turned out differently."&#x2014;<i>World War II Magazine</i> (<i>World War II Magazine</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Philip Bell provides a sharp depth of writing that conveys the detail required in an engaging and informative manner about a multi-faceted conflict that still grips our attention even after all these years.&#x201d;&#x2014;Leslie J M Obre, <i>History Teaching Review</i> (Leslie J M Obre <i>History Teaching Review</i> 2011-10-01)<br><br>"Through a sharp focus on a number of key episodes, Philip Bell's lucid and fascinating analysis is able to highlight the uncertainties of the Second World War, and show that its outcome was at many points less predictable than we often presume."&#x2014;Ian Kershaw (Ian Kershaw)<br><br>"Crammed full of appropriate facts from impartial and impeccable sources, Philip Bell's masterful <i>Twelve Turning Points of the Second World</i> <i>War</i> is an important book for all military and political historians, and should be a recommended read for every English-speaking school sixth form."&#x2014;Patrick Delaforce, author of <i>The Rhine Endeavour</i> and <i>Invasion of the Third Reich</i> (Patrick Delaforce)<br><br>"As in all of his books, Professor Bell's <i>Twelve Turning Points</i> manages to combine vast knowledge, erudite argumentation, and smooth writing in equal measure. The result is that rare bird: a scholarly book that should appeal to a broad audience, from professors to the undergraduates they teach, and from experts to buffs. Along the way, he does something I regarded as impossible: restore the credibility of the most abused concept in the military historical canon, the &#x201c;turning point.&#x201d; By defining the turning point as an event representing &#x201c;decisive or important change,&#x201d; and rejecting the notion of an allegedly magic moment that transformed defeat into victory (or vise versa), Bell has written one of the most sensible books to appear on the war in years. Of course, your list of turning points may diverge from Bell's, but one senses that he wouldn't mind a bit, as long as he has made you think about the topic and a new and interesting way.

How do we explain the fact that people who like strong coffee drink more of it under bright lighting?

Now he's stepping out of his lab to lift the lid on the entire eating experience<b>&#x2014;</b>how the taste, the aroma, and our overall enjoyment of food are influenced by all of our senses, as well as by our mood and expectations.<br><br> The pleasures of food lie mostly in the mind, not in the mouth. Get that straight and you can start to understand what really makes food enjoyable, stimulating, and, most important, memorable.

There is sweet, sour, salty and bitter, for sure. But anything else? Nowadays, most researchers would include umami as the fifth taste. Umami, meaning "delicious taste," was first discovered back in 1908 by Japanese researcher Kikunae Ikeda. This taste is imparted by glutamic acid, an amino acid, and is most commonly associated with monosodium glutamate, itself a derivative of glutamic acid. Some would be tempted to throw metallic, fatty acid, kokumi and as many as fifteen other basic tastes into the mix as well-though even I haven't heard of most of them. And some researchers query whether there are even any "basic" tastes at all!<br><br> The mistake that many people make, though, when talking about food and drink is to mention things like fruity, meaty, herbal, citrusy, burned, smoky and even earthy as tastes. But these are not tastes. Strictly speaking, they are flavors. Don't worry, most people are unaware of this distinction. But how do you tell the difference? Well, hold your nose closed-and what is left is taste (at least assuming that you are not tasting something with a trigeminal hit, like chili or menthol, which activate the trigeminal nerve). So if we struggle to get the basics straight, what hope is there when it comes to some of the more complex interactions taking place between the senses? Taste would be simple, if it weren't so complicated!<br><br> Do you mean taste or do you mean flavor (and does it really matter)?<br><br> Most of what people call taste is actually flavor, and many of the things that they describe as flavors turn out, on closer inspection, to be tastes. Some languages manage to sidestep the issue by using the same word for both taste and flavor. In fact, in English, what we really need is to create a new word-and that neologism is "flave." "I love the flave of that Roquefort" would do the trick. Let's see whether it catches on. There are also challenges here from those stimuli that lie on the periphery. Just take menthol, the minty note you get when chewing gum: is it a taste, a smell or a flavor? Well, all three, in fact; and it also gives rise to a distinctive mouth-cooling sensation. The metallic sensation we get when we taste blood also has the researchers scratching their heads in terms of whether it should be classified as a basic taste, an aroma, a flavor or some combination of the above.<br><br> Most people have heard of the "tongue map." In fact, pretty much every textbook on the senses published over the last seventy-five years or so includes mention of it. The basic idea is that we all taste sweet at the front of the tongue, bitter only at the back, sour at the side, etc. However, the textbooks are wrong: your tongue does not work like that! This widespread misconception resulted from a mistranslation of the findings of an early German PhD thesis that appeared in a popular North American psychology textbook written by Edwin Boring in 1942. So now we have got that cleared up, let me ask, do you actually have any idea how the receptors are laid out on your tongue? No, I didn't think so. Something so fundamental, so important to our survival, and yet none of us really has a clue about how it all works. Shocking, no?<br><br> The taste receptors are not evenly distributed, but neither are they perfectly segmented as the oft-cited tongue map would have us believe. The answer, as is so often the case, lies somewhere in between. Each taste bud is responsive to all five of the basic tastes. But these taste buds are primarily found on the front part of the tongue, on the sides toward the rear of the tongue and on the back of the tongue.There are no taste buds in the middle of the tongue. Interestingly, though, many people (including chefs) tend to say that they experience sweetness more toward the tip of the tongue, they feel the sourness on the sides of the tongue and bitterness/astringency often seems more noticeable toward the back of the tongue. And for me, a pure umami solution has a mouth-filling quality to it that none of the other tastes can quite match.<br><br> The real question, though, is how have so many people been so wrong for so long? Part of the reason may be due to the general neglect of the "lower" senses by research scientists. Another factor probably relates to the "tricks" that our mind plays on us when constructing flavor percepts, things like "oral referral" and "smelled sweetness" (about which more later). As we will see time and again throughout this and the following chapter, in the mouth, very little is as it seems.<br><br> Managing expectations<br><br> Why, you might well ask, does a cook-be they a modernist chef working in a high-end Michelin-starred restaurant or you slaving away in the kitchen preparing for your next dinner party-need to know about what is going on in the mind of the diners they serve? Why not simply rely on the skills that are taught in the culinary schools or picked up from watching those endless cookery shows on TV? Why not focus on the seasonality, the sourcing, the preparation, and possibly also the presentation of the ingredients on the plate? That is all you need, isn't it? As a gastrophysicist, I know just how important it is to get inside the mind of the diner in order to understand and manage their expectations about food. It is only by combining the best food with the right expectations that any of us can hope to deliver truly great tasting experiences.<br><br> It really excites me to see a growing number of young chefs starting to think more carefully about feeding their diners' minds and not just their mouths. I'm sure this is largely down to the influential role of star chefs like Ferran Adri&#x2c6; and Heston Blumenthal, both of whom I have been lucky enough to work with. Where they lead, others surely follow. But that still doesn't answer the more fundamental question of what got the top chefs interested in the minds of their diners in the first place. After all, this certainly isn't something that they teach you at cookery school.<br><br> In Heston's case, it all started with an ice cream. In the late 90s, Heston created a crab ice cream to accompany a crab risotto. The top chef liked the taste and, after a little tinkering, believed it to be perfectly seasoned. But what would the diners say? (Typically, any new dish is trialed in the research kitchen across the road from the restaurant. Then, once it has met with Heston's approval-a slow and exacting process-the next step is to try the new dish out on a few of the regulars and see how they like it. Only if a dish passes all of these hurdles will it stand a chance of making its way on to the restaurant's tasting menu.)<br><br> Imagine the scene: just like in one of the chef's TV shows, you can almost see Heston looking on expectantly from the kitchens, waiting for the diners' approval as his latest culinary creation is brought out to the guinea pigs sitting at the tables. Surely the diners will think it tastes great, given who made it. But, in this case at least, the response was not what was expected. "Urrrggghhh! That's disgusting. It's way too salty." Well, maybe I exaggerate a little-but trust me, the response wasn't good.<br><br> What had gone wrong? How could one of the world's top chefs consider a dish to taste just right only to have some of his regular guests find it far too salty? The answer, I think, tells us a lot about the importance of expectations in our experiences of food and drink. In other words, it is as much a matter of what is in the mind of the person doing the tasting as what is in their mouth or on the plate. When the diners saw that pinkish-red ice cream (this was also evaluated in the lab with a smoked salmon ice cream), their minds immediately made a prediction about what they had been given to eat. Tell me, what would you expect to taste were such a dish to be placed before you?<br><br> For most Westerners, pinkish-red in what looks like a frozen dessert is associated with a sweet fruity ice cream, probably strawberry flavor. "Sweet, fruity, I like it, but it isn't so good for me"-all that goes through a diner's mind in the blink of the eye. After all, one of our brain's primary jobs is to try to figure out which foods are nutritious and worth paying attention to (and perhaps climbing a tree for), and which are potentially poisonous and hence best avoided. However, on the rare occasions when our predictions turn out to be wrong, the surprise, or "disconfirmation of expectation," that follows can come as quite a shock. It can, in fact, be rather unpleasant. The diners in Heston's restaurant presumably thought that they were going to taste something sweet, but what was brought out from the kitchen was actually a savory frozen ice. In other words, they were expecting strawberry and got frozen crab bisque instead! The savory ice may have been popular in England a century ago, but it has very much fallen out of favor these days.<br><br> In a great series of gastrophysics experiments, Martin Yeomans and his team at the University of Sussex, together with Heston, showed that it was possible to radically influence people's perception and liking of the frozen pink treat simply by changing the name of the dish. All it took to modify the participants' expectations in the lab setting was to tell them that this was a savory ice, or else give the dish the mysterious title "Food 386." The expectations that go with the name or description of the dish led people to enjoy the ice cream significantly more than those who had not been told anything about the dish before tasting it. Crucially, they no longer found it too salty either.<br><br> Research suggests that our first exposure to a flavor affects those that come thereafter, even once we know exactly what it is that we are tasting. And though the effects may not always be as dramatic as in the case of Heston's pink savory ice cream, we have probably all had our own experience of this. I still remember, on my first trip to Japan, fifteen years ago, buying a pale-green ice cream from a street vendor. It was a hot spring day and everyone seemed to have one of these refreshing-looking ices in their hands. I had absolutely no doubt that it was mint-flavored, just as it would be back in the U.K. But I recoiled in shock on tasting what turned out to be something most unexpected; it was, in fact, green-tea-flavored ice cream. Delicious in its way, but I must confess that I have somehow never been able to quite get over that initial surprise whenever I am served a bowl in Japan.<br><br> Whatever the name and/or description of a dish, and no matter what it looks like, these cues are always there, helping to set our expectations. And those expectations influence our judgments and perception, however subtly. Even when cooking at home, how those you serve experience your food is as much a matter of what is going on in their minds as it is a matter of what they put in their mouths. However, it is not just the color and other visual properties of food that set our expectations.<br><br> What's in a name?<br><br> Imagine yourself in a fancy restaurant, scanning the menu for something to eat. You already know that you want fish, but which one? Now, let's suppose you came across Patagonian toothfish. Would you order it? No, I didn't think so. Nor, for that matter, did anyone else. Sales of this veritable "monster of the deep" had been disappointing for years. No matter how chefs prepared it, diners just turned their noses up and chose something else instead. Their eyes would continue scanning down the menu, looking for something that sounded, how shall I put it, a little more enticing.<br><br> Would the response be different, do you think, if they were to come across Chilean sea bass on the menu? It certainly sounds a lot more appealing, doesn't it? The thing is, though, that these two names refer to one and the same fish! Sales of this currently sustainable fish have increased by well over 1,000%-yes, that's three zeros-in a number of markets around the world (including North America, the U.K. and Australia). The trick was simple: just change the name. This is one of the most impressive examples of "nudging by naming," as the behavioral economists like to call it. In fact, in no time at all, this fish started appearing on the menus of all the best restaurants, a trend that, even today, shows no signs of letting up. Once again, it is what is in the diner's mind, and the associations they make with different labels or descriptions that are crucial here.<br><br> The frozen crab bisque/smoked salmon ice cream and Patagonian toothfish cases are exceptional: they have, in fact, been chosen to make a particular point-about the importance of naming to our experience of food. Nevertheless, look around and one finds many everyday examples demonstrating much the same point. Have you ever wondered, for instance, why golden rainbow trout is so much more popular than regular brown trout? The traditionally trained chef's mind may immediately start to ponder differences in taste or texture, or perhaps to consider how the fish was dispatched. But why stop there? When was the last time you ate an ugli fruit (the result of the hybridization of a grapefruit-or pomelo-an orange and a tangerine)? Exactly. You have to wonder how much more popular this member of the citrus family could be had it been given another name. The decline in popularity of everything from faggots to pollack and Spotted Dick in recent years can, at least in part, be put down to their unfortunate names.<br><br> Great expectations<br><br> Some of you may already be wondering whether you could use the same naming "tricks" to enhance people's perception of whatever food or beverage product you happen to be serving. Unfortunately, though, I very much doubt that you will be able to increase sales of most everyday foods by anything like as much as the Patagonian toothfish-sorry, Chilean sea bass-example might lead one to believe. Nor, unless you have had your head very firmly stuck in the modernist cookbooks, will the colors of the dishes you prepare at home give as misleading an impression of the actual taste or flavor to come as the pinkish-red hue of Heston's frozen treat undoubtedly did. No one will, I presume, get the wrong end of the stick on seeing whatever you might be thinking of serving at your next dinner party. The colors of the foods we prepare normally give a pretty reliable indicator of the probable tasting experience. It is mostly in the modernist restaurant or when in parts foreign that things start to go awry.

With furigana superscripts, the beginner who is familiar with hiragana and katakana is able to read even the most difficult and obscure kanji at a glance. Other publications either provide little or no guide to kanji readings or romanize some or all of the Japanese words and sentences. Previously, romanized Japanese dictionaries were of some value to students using textbooks that contained no Japanese script. Recently, however, an increasing number of influential curricula around the world are based on a rationale and methodology that demands the introduction of hiragana and katakana from the earliest stages. Learners and their teachers studying under such curricula will inevitably feel more comfortable with a dictionary such as Kodansha's Furigana Japanese-English Dictionary, one that shows the pronunciation of kanji with familiar and authentic kana script. </p><p>But it does not end there. The comprehensive 16,000-word basic vocabulary comprises a generous and balanced selection of native Japanese words, kanji compounds, and foreign loan words. Precise and informative definitions, written specifically for English speakers, offer expert guidance on points of grammar, meaning, style, orthography, pronunciation, and punctuation.

In addition there are 50,000 sample sentences that provide a context-based understanding of how words are linked together to form authentic and natural Japanese sentences. </p><p>Features that help expand word power and increase vocabulary skills have also been included in Kodansha's Furigana Japanese-English Dictionary. Common collocations, derivatives, and compounds show how word-parts fit and work together. Comprehensive cross-referencing makes the learner aware of common synonyms and antonyms, clarifying both meaning and usage. Finally, three appendices explain in detail such complicated areas as conjugating verbs and adjectives, counting, and articulating foreign place names in Japanese. </p><p>All of this and more in a portable format and at an affordable price.

People were not invited -- they went there&#39;. Considered one of the all-time great American works of fiction, Fitzgerald&#39;s glorious yet ultimately tragic social satire on the Jazz Age encapsulates the exuberance, energy and decadence of an era. After the war, the mysterious Jay Gatsby, a self-made millionaire pursues wealth, riches and the lady he lost to another man with stoic determination. He buys a mansion across from her house and throws lavish parties to try and entice her. When Gatsby finally does reunite with Daisy Buchanan, tragic events are set in motion. Told through the eyes of his detached and omnipresent neighbour and friend, Nick Carraway, Fitzgerald&#39;s succinct and powerful prose hints at the destruction and tragedy that awaits.</p><p>In 1922, F. Scott Fitzgerald announced his decision to write "something <i>new</i>--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple + intricately patterned." That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately patterned, and above all, simple novel became <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which he is best known. A portrait of the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and excess, <i>Gatsby</i> captured the spirit of the author's generation and earned itself a permanent place in American mythology. Self-made, self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby embodies some of Fitzgerald's--and his country's--most abiding obsessions: money, ambition, greed, and the promise of new beginnings. "Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning--" Gatsby's rise to glory and eventual fall from grace becomes a kind of cautionary tale about the American Dream.<p> It's also a love story, of sorts, the narrative of Gatsby's quixotic passion for Daisy Buchanan. The pair meet five years before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying, but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means--and to the pursuit of Daisy, which amounts to the same thing. "Her voice is full of money," Gatsby says admiringly, in one of the novel's more famous descriptions. His millions made, Gatsby buys a mansion across Long Island Sound from Daisy's patrician East Egg address, throws lavish parties, and waits for her to appear. When she does, events unfold with all the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama, with detached, cynical neighbor Nick Carraway acting as chorus throughout. Spare, elegantly plotted, and written in crystalline prose, <i>The Great Gatsby</i> is as perfectly satisfying as the best kind of poem.</p>This critical edition of The Great Gatsby draws on the manuscript and surviving proofs of the novel, together with Fitzgerald&#39;s subsequent revisions to key passages to provide the first authoritative text of one of the classic works of the twentieth century.</p><h2>The Favored Daughter: One Woman&#39;s Fight to Lead Afghanistan into the Future</h2><p><p>The nineteenth daughter of a local village leader in rural Afghanistan, Fawzia Koofi was left to die in the sun after birth by her mother.

The volume includes &#34;The Young King,&#34; &#34;The Birthday of the Infanta,&#34; and &#34;The Star-Child.&#34; While these stories are clearly intended for a younger audience, Wilde, with typical sardonic quip declared that the stories were &#34;intended neither for the British child nor the British public.&#34;</p><p>Known for his barbed wit, Oscar Wilde was one of the most successful late-Victorian playwrights and a great celebrity. The Importance of Being Earnest and The Picture of Dorian Gray are among his best known works. He is perhaps most famous for his trial, in which he eloquently defended homosexual love and was sentenced to two years of hard labor.</p><h2>A Concise History of Korea: From Antiquity to the Present</h2><p>Now in a fully revised and updated edition, this comprehensive book surveys Korean history from Neolithic times to the present. Michael J. Seth explores the origins and development of Korean society, politics, and still little-known cultural heritage from their inception to the two Korean states of today. Telling the remarkable story of the origins and evolution of a society that borrowed and adopted from abroad, Seth describes how various tribal peoples in the peninsula came together to form one of the world&#x2019;s most distinctive communities. He shows how this ancient, culturally and ethnically homogeneous society was wrenched into the world of late-nineteenth-century imperialism, fell victim to Japanese expansionism, and then became arbitrarily divided into two opposed halves, North and South, after World War II. <br><br>Tracing the seven decades since 1945, the book explains how the two Koreas, with their deeply different political and social systems and geopolitical orientations, evolved into sharply contrasting societies. South Korea, after an unpromising start, became one of the few postcolonial developing states to enter the ranks of the first world, with a globally competitive economy, a democratic political system, and a cosmopolitan and dynamic culture. North Korea, by contrast, became one of the world&#x2019;s most totalitarian and isolated societies, a nuclear power with an impoverished and famine-stricken population. Seth describes and analyzes the radically different and historically unprecedented trajectories of the two Koreas, formerly one tight-knit society. Throughout, he adds a rare dimension by placing Korean history into broader global perspective. All readers looking for a balanced, knowledgeable history will be richly rewarded with this clear and concise book.</p><p>Michael J. Seth is professor of history at James Madison University.Michael Seth&#x2019;s A Concise History of Korea: From Antiquity to the Present provides readers with a clear, comprehensive, objective, and illuminating survey of Korean history from ancient times to the present. Readers will be inspired by Seth&#x2019;s extensive knowledge of Korean history combined with his understanding of East Asian and world history.... One of the great merits of the text is the presentation of each stage of Korean history within a global context; subsequently, readers will have a deeper understanding of social, cultural, and political history not only in East Asia, but also with other parts of the world.... Additional features of the book include historical maps, primary source entries within each chapter, and a very useful annotated bibliography in English. Educators of Asian and world history on the high school and college levels will benefit from reading this well-written and balanced text on Korean history and culture that offers both regional and global perspectives. Teachers of United States history will profit from reading about the role the United States has played in Korea prior to the division of the peninsula, the Korean War, and postwar policies in Korea compared to those in Japan. All readers will be interested in how South Korea made unprecedented achievements in both democratic and economic development while North Korea became one of the world&#x2019;s most totalitarian and impoverished countries in the world. A Concise History of Korea is timely for its coverage of Korea combined with regional and global perspectives.... Most Americans know too little about Korean history and culture. Seth has published an engaging and worthwhile narrative that provides us with an understanding of Korean history, and how it is as fascinating and unique as its neighbors. (<i>Education About Asia</i>)<br><br>The first edition of Michael Seth's book became a benchmark for an overview of Korean history in English. Now bigger and better, it promises to become a standard for Korean history in any language. (John Lie, University of California, Berkeley)<br><br>In this highly readable text, Michael Seth scores a number of important achievements. He provides a narrative from earliest times to the present that explains the transitions in Korean history in a clear manner and, in the process, doesn&#x2019;t shortchange the premodern period. Seth raises questions that historians have long grappled with and proposes answers. In updating his earlier work, he cites the most recent research, adds a section on Korea from a global perspective, and also provides a primary source entry for each chapter, enabling students to look at original documents. This is an excellent text that includes all the essential information any undergraduate would need. (Edward Shultz, emeritus, University of Hawaii at Manoa)<br><br>Michael Seth's book provides a clear and accessible survey of Korean history, deftly covering all of the key topics that should be included in a course on the subject. I would highly recommend it to anybody looking to gain a stronger understanding of the historical development of Korea. (Gregg A. Brazinsky, George Washington University)<br><br>Now in a fully revised and updated edition, this comprehensive book surveys Korean history from Neolithic times to the present. Michael J.

Taking its title from the colloquial term &#x201c;grass&#x201d;, meaning a work of minor value, Whitman&#x2019;s &#x201c;Leaves of Grass&#x201d; is anything but that. Over his lifetime Whitman would continue to expand and revise his most famous work up until his death in 1892. The first edition contained just twelve poems, significantly smaller compared to the final &#x201c;deathbed&#x201d; edition, reproduced here, which included over 400. &#x201c;Leaves of Grass&#x201d; is unique for its celebration of the sensual pleasures of life in a time when such an attitude was considered immoral. A departure from a poetic tradition which relied on symbolism, allegory, and meditation on the religious and spiritual, &#x201c;Leaves of Grass&#x201d; instead focused on nature and the individual&#x2019;s role in it. Initial reception of the work was quite controversial, but over time this collection of poetry has come to be acknowledged as one of the truly great American works of literature. This edition is printed on premium acid-free paper and includes an introduction by John Burroughs.</p><p>One of the great innovative figures in American letters, Walt Whitman created a daringly new kind of poetry that became a major force in world literature. <i>Leaves Of Grass</i> is his one book. First published in 1855 with only twelve poems, it was greeted by Ralph Waldo Emerson as "the wonderful gift . . . the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed." Over the course of Whitman's life, the book reappeared in many versions, expanded and transformed as the author's experiences and the nation's history changed and grew. Whitman's ambition was to creates something uniquely American. In that he succeeded. His poems have been woven into the very fabric of the American character. From his solemn masterpieces "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd" and "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking" to the joyous freedom of "Song of Myself," "I Sing the Body Electric," and "Song of the Open Road," Whitman's work lives on, an inspiration to the poets of later generations.The poetry of Walt Whitman is the cornerstone of modern American verse. He was America's first truly great poet and his influence is still evident today. The first edition of Whitman's "Leaves of Grass, published in 1855, was a revolutionary manifesto declaring America's independence from European cultural domination. His rhapsodic free verse broke radically with poetic, tradition: it was poetry about America, its democracy, its people, and its hopes. It was uniquely American without apology--brash, proud, optimistic, and filled with the bustling energy of the new and growing nation.<br>This collection brings together Whitman's greatest and most famous poems spanning the whole of his career. From the groundbreaking first edition of "Leaves of Grass are seven poems, including "Song of Myself" and "I Sing the Body Electric."<br>From later editions there are such masterpieces as "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking," and "I Hear America Singing." Also included is Whitman's great cycle of Civil War Poems, "Drum-Taps, which he wrote in the months when he was ministering to the wounded in battlefield hospitals. Concluding this collection is one of his last poems, "Good-bye My Fancy!"--his touching farewell to his muse, his life, and his readers.<br>More than one hundred years after his death, Walt Whitman's poetry has become part of the American heritage. It is a visionary which speaks as aptly to readers today as it will to future generations. As he says in "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," "others...look back on me because I look'd forward to them." Whitman's poetry is a link that connects all Americans--past, present, and future.<br>This book features a deluxe cover, ribbon marker, top stain, and decorative endpaper with a nameplate.</p><h2>Life and Times of Frederick Douglass</h2><p>The progress of his life from a slave to a leader in the movements for emancipation and Negro labor are recounted by this nineteenth-century black leader</p><p><p>Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey (Frederick Douglass) was born a slave in Talbot County, Maryland. He took the name Douglass after escaping from the South in 1838.</p><p>As a leader in the abolitionist movement, Douglass was famed for his eloquent yet incisive political writing. And, like his near-contemporary, Booker T. Washington, understood the central importance of education in improving the lives of African Americans, and was therefore an early proponent of desegregation.</p><p>A firm believer in equal rights for all, Douglass attended a meeting of the National Council of Women in Washington, D.C., in the hours before his death in February 1895.</p></p><h2>A History of Opera</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;The best single volume ever written on the subject, such is its range, authority, and readability.&#x201d;&#x2015;<em>Times Literary Supplement</em></strong></p> Why has opera transfixed and fascinated audiences for centuries? Carolyn Abbate and Roger Parker answer this question in their &#x201c;effervescent, witty&#x201d; (<em>Die Welt</em>, Germany) retelling of the history of opera, examining its development, the musical and dramatic means by which it communicates, and its role in society. Now with an expanded examination of opera as an institution in the twenty-first century, this &#x201c;lucid and sweeping&#x201d; (<em>Boston Globe</em>) narrative explores the tensions that have sustained opera over four hundred years: between words and music, character and singer, inattention and absorption. Abbate and Parker argue that, though the genre&#x2019;s most popular and enduring works were almost all written in a distant European past, opera continues to change the viewer&#x2015; physically, emotionally, intellectually&#x2015;with its enduring power. 24 pages of illustrations</p><p><p><strong>Carolyn Abbate</strong>, professor of music at Harvard University, is the author of <em>Unsung Voices</em> and <em>In Search of Opera</em>.

This anthology focuses on the interconnections of technology, society, and values. It offers writings by authorities as varied as Freeman Dyson, Laurence Lessig, Bruno Latour, and Judy Wajcman that will introduce readers to recent thinking about technology and provide them with conceptual tools, a theoretical framework, and knowledge to help understand how technology shapes society and how society shapes technology. It offers readers a new perspective on such current issues as globalization, the balance between security and privacy, environmental justice, and poverty in the developing world. The careful ordering of the selections and the editors' introductions give Technology and Society a coherence and flow that is unusual in anthologies. The book is suitable for use in undergraduate courses in STS and other disciplines. The selections begin with predictions of the future that range from forecasts of technological utopia to cautionary tales. These are followed by writings that explore the complexity of sociotechnical systems, presenting a picture of how technology and society work in step, shaping and being shaped by one another. Finally, the book goes back to considerations of the future, discussing twenty-first-century challenges that include nanotechnology, the role of citizens in technological decisions, and the technologies of human enhancement.<br></p></p><p>Deborah G.

The authors lay out a strategy for future art historians and theorists.&#34;--Paula Harper, University of Miami</p><h2>Prosperity Without Growth: Economics for a Finite Planet</h2><p><i>Prosperity without Growth</i> challenges the embedded, unquestioned assumptions of the global policy of growth and shows that it is necessary&#x2014;and possible&#x2014;to have increased and widespread prosperity without economic growth.<br><br>The modern economy is reliant on economic growth for stability. When growth falters, politicians panic, businesses fail, people lose jobs, and recession looms. Tim Jackson argues, however, that continual growth is just not possible, not sustainable&#x2014;to believe so is ignoring our knowledge of the finite resource base and fragile ecology in which we live.<br><br>The book starts with a compelling analysis of the consequences&#x2014;for the planet and for people&#x2019;s wellbeing&#x2014;of the relentless pursuit of economic growth and material goods. It illustrates why a return to business as usual after the current financial crisis is not an option. Prosperity for a few founded on ecological destruction and persistent social injustice is no foundation for a civilized society. <br><br>The current economic crisis presents a unique opportunity to invest in change and a future that delivers lasting prosperity for the predicted 9 billion people who will inhabit the earth in 2050. The author&#x2014;a leading expert and advisor to the UK government&#x2014;concludes by outlining pathways towards a sustainable economy. It involves radically changing our &#x201c;shop until you drop&#x201d; mentality, as well as engaging other disruptive economic practices. Jackson doesn&#x2019;t claim this will be easy, but points out that while action is urgent, it is possible.<br><br>The book opens up dialogue on the most urgent task of our times&#x2014;the challenge of a new prosperity encompassing our ability to flourish as human beings&#x2014;within the ecological limits of a finite planet.</p><p>Tim Jackson is the Sustainable Development Commission&#x2019;s Economics Commissioner. He is also Professor of Sustainable Development at the University of Surrey and Director of the newly-awarded ESRC Research Group on Lifestyles, Values and Environment (RESOLVE).<p><strong>'On a planet with finite resources, perpetual growth is not only impossible, but it is endangering the survival of present and future generations. I urge everyone to read Tim Jackson's brilliant and visionary book. He offers a detailed critique of the existing economic paradigm, and makes compelling suggestions for a shared and lasting prosperity.'</strong> - <em>Bianca Jagger, Founder and Chair, Bianca Jagger Human Rights Foundation; Council of Europe Goodwill Ambassador; Member of the Executive Director's Leadership Council, Amnesty International, USA; Trustee, Amazon Charitable Trust</em> </p> <p><strong>'In a world of massive inequality and limited resources, Tim Jackson asks the fundamental questions of what prosperity really is and how we can invest not just in material goods but in each other. This is an outstandingly intelligent and creative contribution to debate.'</strong> <em>- The Most Revd&nbsp;and Rt Hon Dr Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury </em></p> <p><strong>'Tim Jackson offers a penetrating insight into our current state of affairs, and a thought-provoking pathway towards redesigning our future.'</strong> - <em>Dame Ellen MacArthur </em></p> <p><strong>'The question of whether progressives should abandon growth or continue a champion it remains unresolved.

Included are reproductions of approximately 114 of Darger's collage drawings and fifteen selections from his writings, focusing on his life's work. <i>In the Realms of the Unreal</i>, which is an account of a cosmic struggle against child slavery unfolding on a planet vastly larger than our own. This battle between the forces of good--led by the intrepid Vivian sisters--and the evil Glandelinian nations, was illustrated and extended in Darger's art, including the mural-size watercolor drawings that represent his mature achievement as an artist.<br><br>Michael Bonesteel, a Chicago-based art critic and authority on outsider art, provides an introduction to Darger's work and narrates the Dickensian circumstances of his childhood which, along with his profound religious faith and doubt, shaped his extraordinary sensibility. A true American original, Henry Darger combined an unquestionable innocence with a dark and sometimes deeply disturbing vision to create a body of work of originality and lasting impact.<br><br></p><p>The voluminous works of Henry Darger were discovered after his death in 1973 by his landlord in a crowded and almost derelict apartment on Chicago's Northside. Among the piles of newspapers, magazines, and hundreds of balls of twine were scrapbooks made from telephone books and an entire lifetime of creative work. <i>Henry Darger: Art and Selected Writings</i> is an amazing window into the extraordinary world of this outsider artist.<p> In order to escape his unhappy childhood in a mental institution and his reclusive adult life, Darger created his own salvation in the form of an intricate fantasy world of drawings and stories revolving around a set of little girl heroines, with vivid watercolors and collages of children engaged in battles against their enemies. The images are violent and strange, yet they achieve a fragile beauty. His work has taken a long time to gain attention in part due to his disturbing "obsession with little girls ... as hermaphrodites with small penises--and worse, a significant number of works that graphically depicted the strangulation, evisceration, and wholesale slaughter of children." Beyond the graphic nature of the artwork is a story that intertwines religion, superstition, loneliness, and bravery. This remarkable book offers the chance to take a journey through the life, mind, and creative process of a true artist, and it includes entries from his personal diaries and chapters from his fictional saga, "In the Realms of the Unreal." <i>--J.P.

After his father's ddeath, he ran away to Chicago where he lived the rest of his life, worknig as a janitor, dishwasher, and bandage roller in three local hospitals. By night he wrote his great unfinished novel, <i>In the Realms of the Unreal</i>, and later created the artworks for which he is best known.

Now, quantum mechanics promises that some of humanity's wildest dreams may be realized. Serious scientists, working from Einstein's theories, have been investigating the phenomenon known as "entanglement," one of the strangest aspects of our strange universe. According to Einstein, quantum mechanics required entanglement &#x2014; the idea that subatomic particles could become linked, and that a change to one such particle would instantly be reflected in its counterpart, even if separated by a universe. Einstein felt that if quantum theory could produce such bizarre effects, then it had to be invalid. But new experiments show that not only does it happen, but that it may lead to unbreakable codes, and even teleportation, perhaps in our lifetime.</p><p>Amir D. Aczel is a professor at Bentley College in Wallham, MA.In his newest book, Aczel (Fermat's Last Theorem) discusses a great mystery in physics: the concept of entanglement in quantum physics. He begins by explaining that "entanglement" occurs when two subatomic particles are somehow connected or "entangled" with one another, so that when something happens to one particle, the same thing simultaneously happens to the other particle, even if it's miles away. However, this concept violates the theory of special relativity, since communication between two places cannot occur faster than the speed of light. Einstein knew that the mathematics of quantum theory predicted that this could happen, but he didn't believe it. In the last decade, researchers have shown in laboratory experiments that entanglement does indeed happen, and in one case it occurred over a distance of almost 10 miles. Aczel explores how a Star Trek-like teleportation may be possible via entanglement (however, a particle's quantum state, not the entire particle, is teleported to its mate), though perhaps at the expense of demonstrating entanglement's more real-world applications to cryptography. General readers may need to skim over his technical explanations, whereas more advanced readers will be interested in only the last third of the book. While the book won't satisfy dedicated science buffs, it will be an accessible entry into this concept of quantum physics.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Writing and Analysis in the Law</h2><p>A standard-setter in American legal education, Writing and Analysis in the Law provides a guide to legal writing, focusing on the importance of clear organization in written and oral communications.

The THIEME Atlas of Anatomy integrates anatomy and clinical concepts Organized intuitively, with self-contained guides to specific topics on every two-page spread Hundreds of clinical applications integrated into the anatomical descriptions, emphasizing the vital link between anatomical structure and function Beautifully illustrated with expertly rendered digital watercolors, cross-sections, x-rays, and CT and MRI scans Clearly labeled images help you easily identify each structure Summary tables throughout ideal for rapid review Setting a new standard for the study of anatomy, the THIEME Atlas of Anatomy is more than a collection of anatomical illustrationsit is an indispensable resource for anyone who works with the human body</p><p>IllustratorsThe images are beautifully drawn and labeled, and it is clear that significant time and effort have gone into the organization of the material. In addition to clear and unique illustrations, this atlas departs from the typical anatomy atlas by combining explanatory text with the images, providing summarizing tables, and giving clinical applications for the material. This atlas would be a good choice for the reader interested in neuromusculoskeletal system reference. ..The narrative works to enhance understanding of a given topic by referring the reader to other sections of this atlas that continue to elaborate on specific points. For the physical therapy, athletic training, or medical student trying to master the specifics associated with muscle function, the 2-adjoining-page organization of tables with illustrations of the muscles is a feature that would assist studying this material. Other features of this atlas that are particular strengths include an excellent index, concepts needed to understand anatomy, clear illustration and annotation, overview of basic embryology, overviews of the autonomic nervous system, illustrations identifying landmarks that can be easily palpated, bones and joints, neurovascular and lymphatic systems, the addition of schematic illustrations to clarify hard to visualize structures, many common and some rare clinical conditions, some select MRIs, and a number of other special topics. Overall, a beautiful and well-organized atlas of musculoskeletal anatomy.. The narrative provided, along with functional grouping of muscles and clinical application, have resulted in a relatively novel presentation of the musculoskeletal system that most students will appreciate.--Journal of Orthopedic Sports and Physical TherapyA useful addition to the library of any clinician interested in the musculoskeletal system. It contains beautiful illustrations of musculoskeletal anatomy and clear, descriptive legends, many of which are detailed. This volume offers more value than a typical atlas because of the substantial amount of functional and clinical information that is included. ...It warrants consideration as the required atlas for any gross anatomy course for physical therapist students... It also would make a fine supplemental resource for preclinical laboratory courses that emphasize skeletal and muscular anatomy and for any physical therapy clinic&#39;s reference library.--Physical Therapy, June 2006This atlas contains superior illustrations of the musculoskeletal system of the trunk, upper, and lower extremities, as well as a concise but very informative overview of general anatomical concepts. Notably, the musculature - functional groups provides a fact box on each muscle, as well as a unique schematic that clearly demonstrates each muscle&#39;s action. The neurovascular system - forms and relations subsection of each of the chapters provides a compelling demonstration of anatomical relations and concepts of innervation. The intention in creating this text was to provide an atlas that would guide students in their study of anatomy, stimulate enthusiasm, and provide a reliable reference for experienced students and professionals. This Thieme atlas fulfills these intentions. For the novice, the general anatomy chapter provides a very descriptive overview of anatomical concepts with brief text and good diagrams. In the following three chapters, the image quality is quite impressive, illustrating excellent anatomical relations. The fact box included on each muscle provides easy reference to origin, insertion, innervation, and action. The illustrations are clearly labeled...The index is appropriate and easy to follow. For experienced students and professionals, clinical application, cross sections, x-rays, and CT and MRI scans are provided to further emphasize the clinical relevance of anatomy. Additionally, biomechanical presentations for functional groups of muscles are well-described and</p><h2>The Heidegger Controversy: A Critical Reader</h2><p><p>This anthology is a significant contribution to the debate over the relevance of Martin Heidegger's Nazi ties to the interpretation and evaluation of his philosophical work. Included are a selection of basic documents by Heidegger, essays and letters by Heidegger's colleagues that offer contemporary context and testimony, and interpretive evaluations by Heidegger's heirs and critics in France and Germany.In his new introduction, "Note on a Missing Text," Richard Wolin uses the absence from this edition of an interview with Jacques Derrida as a springboard for examining questions about the nature of authorship and personal responsibility that are at the heart of the book.</p></p><p>Richard Wolin is Professor of Modern European Intellectual History and Humanities at Rice University.

It is divided into three parts: Heidegger's own writings pertinent to his association with and attitudes toward Nazism (several of which, being basic, appear also in the aforementioned books); writings by his contemporaries; and, finally, essays by recent European critics.

Beginning with her great-grandfather, who rose from rural poverty to become an influential landowner, and continuing to the present, Mai Elliott traces her family's journey through an era of tumultuous change. She tells us of childhood hours in her grandmother's silk shop, and of hiding while French troops torched her village, watching while blossoms torn by fire from the trees flutter "like hundreds of butterflies" overhead. She makes clear the agonizing choices that split Vietnamese families: her eldest sister left her staunchly anti-communist home to join the Viet Minh, and spent months sleeping in jungle camps with her infant son, fearing air raids by day and tigers by night. And she follows several family members through the last, desperate hours of the fall of Saigon-including one nephew who tried to escape by grabbing the skid of a departing American helicopter. Based on family papers, dozens of interviews, and a wealth of other research, this is not only a memorable family saga but a record of how the Vietnamese themselves have experienced their times.</p><p>Most books about Vietnam focus on the French who colonized it or the Americans who sought to "save" it. This combination of memoir and family history shows the Vietnamese "as they saw themselves as the central players in their own history." The author's perspective is particularly enlightening because her relatives, though unquestionably better-educated and better-off than the typical Vietnamese, made a variety of political and social choices over the course of the turbulent century she chronicles. Her great-grandfather was a mandarin and member of the imperial court; her father was a government official under French rule; her older sister married a Communist. Elliott herself enrolled in Georgetown's School of Foreign Service in 1960, married an American, and supported the U.S. crusade in Vietnam until her experiences interviewing Vietcong prisoners of war for a Rand Corporation study convinced her that the corrupt Saigon regime failed to offer a convincing alternative to Communism. Because she had family on both sides, Elliott's portrait of the war is subtler and less didactic than previous accounts by proponents of either ideology. Her prose is a bit formal and dense for the casual reader, but by telling her relatives' personal stories and explicating their culture's traditional values, her reflective narrative makes humanly complicated a history too often oversimplified. <i>--Wendy Smith</i><br><strong>Mai Elliott </strong>was born and raised in Vietnam and attended Georgetown University on a scholarship. She lived in Vietnam again from 1963 to 1968 and worked for the Rand Corporation interviewing Viet Cong prisoners of war. She returned to the U.S. in 1968 and now lives in California.<br></p><h2>Lewis Carroll in Numberland: His Fantastical Mathematical Logical Life</h2><p><p><strong>A penetrating work that explores the amazing imagination and mathematical genius of the man who wrote <em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</em>.</strong></p> Just when we thought we knew everything about Lewis Carroll, here comes a highly original biography that will appeal to Alice fans everywhere. Fascinated by the inner life of Charles Lutwidge Dodson, Robin Wilson, a Carroll scholar and a noted mathematics professor, has produced this revelatory book&#x2015;filled with more than one hundred striking and often playful illustrations&#x2015;that examines the many inspirations and sources for Carroll's fantastical writings, mathematical and otherwise. As Wilson demonstrates, Carroll&#x2015;who published serious, if occasionally eccentric, works in the fields of geometry, logic, and algebra&#x2015;made significant contributions to subjects as varied as voting patterns and the design of tennis tournaments, in the process creating imaginative recreational puzzles based on mathematical ideas. In the tradition of Sylvia Nasar's <em>A Beautiful Mind</em> and Andrew Hodges's <em>Alan Turing</em>, this is an engaging look at the incredible genius of one of mathematics' and literature's most enigmatic minds. 100 illustrations</p><p>Robin Wilson is the author and editor of more than thirty books, including Four Colors Suffice and Lewis Carroll in Wonderland. He is a professor of pure mathematics at the Open University, and a Fellow of Keble College, Oxford University. He lives in London.British mathematician Wilson (<i>Four Colors Suffice</i>) paints a charming picture of Charles Dodgson, aka Lewis Carroll, in this slender biography. Skipping over the most chronicled aspects of Dodgson's life with only a sharp side note deriding rumors of his pedophilia as bad history and bad psychology, Wilson focuses on Dodgson's mathematical and educational accomplishments: pamphlets and books on Euclid, an efficient way of calculating determinants, astute analysis of election methods, and systems of mnemonics and ciphers. Wilson also includes puzzles (some with unsatisfying solutions); a number of Dodgson's photographs, for which Wilson labels him one of the most important photographers of the nineteenth century; and humorous and satirical letters suggesting political postulates such as, Let it be granted, that a speaker may digress from any one point to any other point. Though Dodgson was apparently not always a brilliant teacher or writer in his field, Wilson chooses some of his best work for the examples, and any fan of Victorian mind-benders or mid-level mathematics will enjoy the Dodo's witty and eager explanations of logical puzzles and games. 100 illus. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He has served as a contributing editor for the&nbsp;<i>Village Voice&nbsp;</i>and as the arts editor of the&nbsp;<i>Fort Worth Star-Telegram</i>.<br>"He holds the distinction of being a public intellectual, one of a handful of art critics known and read by a wider audience. . . . Hickey is neither art criticism&#x2019;s reactionary philosopher king nor its populist Robin Hood, but a sensualist with an acquired taste for art that is resistant to interpretation and unapologetically elitist, a term he halfheartedly redeems as a positive value. He&#x2019;s a colorful essayist and a perceptive critic." (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>"Throughout these trenchant essays on female artists, Hickey is characteristically incisive, challenging, and weird. . . . Regardless of reputation, Hickey always deploys the same lively rigor. The introduction, titled 'A Ladies' Man,' in which Hickey explains how 'most of my favorite people are women,' emerges as a surprisingly powerful piece of memoir." (<i>Publishers Weekly, starred review</i>)<br><br><p>"If you're an artist or an art lover, this needs to be on the top of your reading list."</p> (<i>Bustle</i>)<br><br>"Hickey has sizzle. He rattles cages and yanks chains as an art writer of voracious attentiveness, free-spirited intelligence, invigorating wit, vinegary candor, and a gift for literary constructions of provoking finesse. . . . He balances incisive, funny, idiosyncratic biographical observations with all-senses-firing immersions in the art under discussion, racing off on tangents and nailing down arresting perceptions about what we expect from art and what we receive. . . . The artists are significant and intriguing, Hickey's criticism exceptionally dynamic and enlightening." (<i>Booklist, starred review</i>)<br><br>"Less a book of criticism than an engaging treatment of some of the most fascinating contemporary artists. Highly recommended." (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>"One of the most interesting books anyone has <i>ever </i>written about women artists. There is no bogus effort to find strained 'commonalities' or 'shared sensibilities.' Each artist is absolutely 'complete' in and of herself. There is stunning and polymathic erudition, connoisseurship and theoretical <i>nous</i> here, but one must also cherish the book for the endless, morphing, sparking, sparkling <i>ideas </i>taking shape on every page. &nbsp;It's as if someone were setting off exciting little squibs in almost every sentence--fun for sure, but often with an extraordinary pay-off: so many of them blossom into huge beautiful fireworks that then proceed to hang up there in the sky. The charmed voice never wearies or disappoints." (Terry Castle)<br><br>"Idiosyncratic assessments of contemporary women painters, sculptors, and installation and performance artists by an enfant terrible of art criticism.

(Jeremy Gilbert Rolph)<br><br>&#x201c;Dave Hickey is not lacking in chutzpah; he has, after all, on occasion been referred to as the &#x2018;bad boy&#x2019; of art criticism.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>25 Women </i>resembles an unfettered, if highly enriching, dump of Hickey's free-associative musings.... The text zooms from anecdotes about Hickey's youth in the cattle yards of Texas, to his time spent hobnobbing with the likes of Andy Warhol in New York, to a meta description of the home office in which he is writing. We get a similarly panoptic run at the various female subjects, including personal biography, cultural context, and fictitious narratives meant to elucidate deeper truths about their art.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;For Hickey, art is not a dead object to be seen and dryly interpreted; rather the act of viewing art creates its own meaning. Again and again, he describes the process of confronting a piece of art that resists him and then feeling a blurring of boundaries between himself and the work, something akin to a momentary out-of-body experience.&#x201d; (Caitlin Smith Rimschnick <i>Bookslut</i>)</p><h2>Scalp Acupuncture and Clinical Cases</h2><p>Scalp acupuncture is a traditional Chinese therapy used to treat the hemiplegia, numbness of limbs and aphasia caused by cerebral thrombosis, cerebral haemorrhage or cerebral embolism through stimulating related parts of the scalp corresponding to the cerebral cortex with acupuncture needles.

Each student faces difficulties with different English sounds depending on those sounds and distinctions of his or her native language. To help minimize the time spent tailoring classroom materials to the needs of each student, Nilsen and Nilsen have compiled a comprehensive volume on those sound contrasts distinguished in English. They provide extensive lists of both vowel and consonant contrasts, each with phonetic diagrams and descriptions, minimal pairs (both isolated and in sentences), and specific languages for which the contrast may be problematic. Both prospective and practicing teachers will appreciate the freedom of not having to compile these materials themselves. Instead, they can focus on their primary goal the teaching of English.</p><p>Title of related interest also from Waveland Press: Smith et al., Communicate: Strategies for International Teaching Assistants (ISBN 9781577665304).</p><h2>Introduction to Logic</h2><p>Introduction to Logic is a proven textbook that has been honed through the collaborative efforts of many scholars over the last five decades.&nbsp; Its scrupulous attention to detail and precision in exposition and explanation is matched by the greatest accuracy in all associated detail.&nbsp; In addition, it continues to capture student interest through its personalized human setting and current examples. The 14th Edition of Introduction to Logic, written by Copi, Cohen &amp; McMahon, is dedicated to the many thousands of students and their teachers - at hundreds of universities in the United States and around the world - who have used its fundamental methods and techniques of correct reasoning in their everyday lives.</p><p>Copi and Cohen&#39;s Introduction to Logic, Ninth Edition, is by far the most complete treatment of introductory logic, both deductive and inductive, both classical and modern. It is the standard text in logic today--the paradigm of clarity and accuracy. This text enables all students to understand, recognize, and apply classical syllogistic logic and the more powerful techniques of modern symbolic logic. Lively argumentative excerpts from politics, philosophy, science, and contemporary controversies bring substance and life to the study of logic--demonstrating the application of logical principles by serious writers and thinkers trying to solve real problems. Arguments excerpted as illustrations and as exercise material include examples of fallacies to show students how arguments go wrong when logical principles are ignored or misapplied. A few examples of argumentative reasoning were constructed for the book to demonstrate principles; however, it is the wealth of current, up-to-date examples selected from actual texts representing many fields of interest that set this book apart.<p> Many changes will be found in this new edition of <i>Introduction to Logic,</i> but instructors who have used previous editions may be assured that the integrity and spirit of this book have been retained. Much of the detail of previous editions and most of the exercises also have been retained. The changes introduced&#x2014;of five different kinds&#x2014;are designed to make this well-tested volume more accessible, and thus more effective as an instrument in the teaching of elementary logic. We recount these changes briefly here, addressing this report mainly to those acquainted with previous editions. </p> <p><b><i>A Revised Chapter 1.</i></b></p> <p> Structural changes have been made in the first part of the book. The expansion of the opening chapters in the preceding edition was found by many users to hinder student progress along what may be called "the main line" of instruction in logic. We have therefore compressed the material of what was Part One into a single opening chapter in which the same topics are addressed, but more crisply, and in ways likely to provide a better base for the more advanced material in the later chapters of the book. Chapter 1 has now become very hefty as a result&#x2014;but it is also richer, more clearly formulated, and more fun to read. </p> <p><b><i>Exposition-Rules and Definitions.</i></b></p> <p> The most pervasive of the changes in this edition, and most important too, we think, are the very many adjustments in the ways in which theoretical matters are explained and expressed. We have long prided ourselves on the logical accuracy of <i>Introduction to Logic,</i> and of course we would do nothing to injure our hard-earned reputation for reliability. But our colleagues around the country have advised us, on many occasions, that our efforts to be exact, and to cut no corners, have in some parts of the book resulted in formulations rather difficult to digest&#x2014;especially for beginning students. </p> <p> This is not an easy matter to address. We have worked hard to ameliorate this problem&#x2014;and if we have succeeded in this edition many of the resultant changes will be hardly noticeable. Explanations should be formulated in language that is transparent and thoroughly perspicuous, and (we hope) that will cause few brows to wrinkle. </p> <p> Some illustrations of the kind of changes we have made are worth noting. Several of our colleagues observed that, where a set of rules or criteria have been put forward (as, for example, those to test the validity of categorical syllogisms, or to appraise the merit of analogical arguments), our exposition relied too heavily, in referring to a rule, upon the number assigned to it rather than to the substance of the rule itself. We have reformulated such exposition, consistently referring now to the rule itself. </p> <p> Another example of reformulation will be noted in the chapter on definition. Previously, in explaining methods of defining, we caused needless confusion by using that much misunderstood word "connotation." The terms "connotation" and "denotation" were not employed erroneously, but to avoid confusion, we now rely fully upon the terms "intension" and "extension" in explaining techniques of definition. </p> <p> Even format can serve to confuse, or to clarify. It was and remains our practice, in presenting deductive exercises in symbols, to mark the conclusion of an argument with the three triangular dots (.-.) that commonly represent "therefore." But in earlier editions we had sometimes placed this sign on the same line as the last premise of the argument, after a slash; and sometimes we had placed this sign on a separate line of its own. This proved to be a source of distraction if not confusion, so we now consistently place the three-dot "therefore" sign of conclusion on a separate line. This format enables students to see more sharply the claim that the argument is making, and what the target of a needed proof must be. </p> <p> Many such adjustments appear in this edition, far too many to permit their identification in this Preface. In some cases the change is no more than the clarification of a transition, in others the tightening of a paragraph in which the prose was blurred. A textbook in logic ought to be concise, but it must also be precise; precision and clarity we have prized above all. </p> <p> Along with such adjustments we have sought, where feasible, to strike a lighter and more friendly tone in this edition, to introduce illustrations or observations that may amuse as they instruct. The study of logic is sometimes laborious, but it need not be forbidding. </p> <p><b><i>Sidebars.</i></b></p> <p> Those who study logic with the help of this book differ very greatly in the range of their interests and in the degree of their preparation. We will not be satisfied if we fail to challenge those who are most well prepared and most acute; but those coming to systematic logic for the first time also deserve support and guidance appropriate for them. To this end, we have introduced a device that is wholly new to <i>Introduction to Logic:</i> We have sought to distinguish some portions in some chapters that may, for good reasons, be omitted in some learning contexts, or may be treated by instructors as tangential to "the main line." These portions can serve to challenge some students who feel ready for additional work. </p> <p> Finding a way to do this without injury to the whole is problematic. We have adopted the simple device of a sidebar. These sidebars take two forms, "Advanced Material" and "For Enrichment." We emphasize that this contrivance is not meant to depreciate the passages so marked off, which are often especially interesting and demanding. But such sidebar material, we hope, will make it easier for instructors to guide their own students to a mastery of the elements of theory most critical for them&#x2014;and perhaps to avoid some complexities not essential for their solid grasp of elementary logic. Many instructors will simply ignore these markings, and may do so without damage to the understanding of their students. </p> <p><b><i>Technical Changes.</i></b></p> <p> Some technical changes have been introduced into this edition of <i>Introduction to Logic</i>&#x2014;changes that we think reduce ambiguity and thus support instruction. </p> <p> For example, we have responded to the frequently expressed concern of colleagues by expanding the discussion of logical equivalence in Chapter 8, now more sharply emphasizing the differences between material equivalence as a truth-functional connective, and logical equivalence as a logical relation that justifies the rules of replacement. An entirely new section on this topic (section 8.6) has been inserted, and in this section we have introduced a new symbol for logical equivalence as well. </p> <p> In earlier editions we allowed the equivalences expressed by the rules of replacement&#x2014;the last 10 of the 19 Rules of Inference&#x2014;to be symbolized by the same three-bar symbol with which material equivalence ("if and only if") is symbolized throughout. This practice had some justification, but it surely led to student confusion when, for example, rules of replacement were formulated in which the three-bar symbol appeared more than once, with more than one meaning. A distinct symbol was needed. </p> <p> Selecting that symbol has been a matter of long-continuing deliberation. Many alternatives were considered and rejected for reasons pedagogical or theoretical or aesthetic. We have chosen to retain the three-bar symbol, <i>over</i> which a small T indicates that the equivalence confronted is a tautology. This achieves the teaching aim, we think, with a minimum of disruption. Students are rarely called upon to write the symbol for logical equivalence&#x2014;but can (with this notation) recognize it unambiguously when it appears in the list of he rules of replacement that natural deduction employs. </p> <p> Elsewhere in the treatment of deduction, we have changed the design of Venn diagrams in representing Categorical Syllogisms. Where previously we had used simple shading to mark off what the premises of the argument rule out, we have in this edition used slanted lines. This permits the impact of each of the two premises of a syllogism to be distinguished, and because their lines are slanted in opposite directions, a cross-hatching results when the logical impacts of the two premises overlap. Different colors we chose not to use, not wanting to convey the suggestion that students would need anything more than an ordinary pencil to employ Venn diagrams for themselves. </p> <p><b><i>Revised Exercises.</i></b></p> <p> Finally, exercise sets provided at the close of many sections have been enriched. Many exercises have been added, some removed. As in previous editions of <i>Introduction to Logic,</i> we have sought to provide a wide array of illustrative passages, where possible on controversial issues likely to be of genuine interest to college students. Some contrived exercises are still used, or course, but we take pride in the fact that the exercises are for the most part extracted from worthy books and periodicals of very great variety. We have not excluded the writing of classical, and even ancient philosophers&#x2014;but we greatly favor arguments and illustrations produced in the push and pull of discourse in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. </p> <p> As in the past, we have scrupulously avoided partisanship in selecting these materials. When some passage provides a telling example of some mistake in reasoning, or a fine illustration of some argumentative technique, we have included it whatever our judgment of its conclusion might be. What we wrote in the Preface to the preceding edition we again affirm: The argumentative chips must be allowed to fall where they may. </p> <p> Finally, we draw attention to the substantial influence of criticisms and suggestions received from colleagues, senior and junior&#x2014;whose names and institutions are noted elsewhere in these pages. We strive to make <i>Introduction to Logic</i> a teaching instrument ever more finely tuned, and the responses of readers around the world have given us splendid help in spotting errors and identifying deficiencies. We earnestly welcome this thoughtful engagement-and for this continuing and widespread support we express here, not for the first or the last time, our heartfelt appreciation. </p></p><h2>Second-Hand Time</h2><p>Worn cover and page edges marked, a small amount of pencil underlining Shipped from the U.K. All orders received before 3pm sent that weekday.</p><p>Svetlana Alexievich was born in Ivano-Frankovsk, Ukraine in 1948 and has spent most of her life in the Soviet Union and present-day Belarus, with prolonged periods of exile in Western Europe.

In this lively book, C. M. Woolgar explores the fascinating details of life in a great house. Based on extensive investigation of household accounts and related primary documents, Woolgar vividly illuminates the operations of great households. He also delineates the major changes that transformed the economy and geography of both lay and clerical households between 1200 and 1500.<br><br>In this portrait of aristocratic and gentry life in medieval England, Woolgar describes the roles of family members, the situations of servants, the uses of space within the household, food and drink for daily consumption and for special occasions, furnishing, clothing, arrangements for travel, household animals, cleanliness and hygiene, entertainment, the practices of religion, and intellectual life. The author also analyzes the qualitative and social evolution of great households as definitions of magnificence and conventions of etiquette became increasingly elaborate. <br><br></p><p>Outside the present-day royal households, little remains in Britain that can compare with the "great household." A gradually dying entity since the early 20th century, the great household included family, servants, and hangers-on, and provided more than merely food and shelter for its members. As C.M. Woolgar argues in his book <i>The Great Household in Late Medieval England</i>, the great household functioned as a social microcosm and, consequently, day-to-day life in and around the household provides valuable insight into the period's social history.<p> <i>The Great Household</i> examines the basic characteristics of both aristocratic and gentry households between 1200 and 1500: size, membership, dynamics, economics, and social context. Woolgar bases his study on the households of two aristocrats, two gentry families, and two bishops. Together, they provide examples of a style of living at different ranks of upper-class society and a geographical spread across the country. Eight chapters focus on various elements of medieval life, including food and drink, rituals of preparing and consuming meals, religion and intellectual life, household size, and concepts of hospitality. He supplements his study with tables, period illustrations and illuminations, and contemporary photographs. An archivist and head of special collections at the University of Southampton, Woolgar enthusiastically embraces his subject matter and knows it well. Frequently, however, his passion for detail obfuscates critical analysis and broader contrast of medieval households with each other or with those of other periods.

Shape-shifting also belongs in the landscape of magic, witchcraft, and wonder, and enlivens classical mythology, early modern fairy tales and uncanny fictions of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In <em>Fantastic Metamorphoses, Other Worlds</em>, acclaimed novelist and critic Marina Warner explores the metaphorical power of metamorphoses in the evocation of human personality. Beginning with Ovid's great poem, <em>The Metamorphoses</em>, as the founding text of the metamorphic tradition, she takes us on a journey of exploration, into the fantastic art of Hieronymous Bosch, the legends of the Taino people, the life cycle of the butterfly, the myth of Leda and the Swan, the genealogy of the Zombie, the pantomime of Aladdin, the haunting of doppelgangers, the coming of photography, and the late fiction of Lewis Carroll. Beautifully illustrated and elegantly written, <em>Fantastic Metamorphoses, Other Worlds</em> is sure to appeal to all readers interested in mythology, art, and literature.</p><p><br>Marina Warner is a prize-winning novelist, cultural historian, and critic. Her most recent novel is <em>The Leto Bundle</em>. Among her acclaimed non-fiction works are <em>From the Beast to the Blonde</em> and <em>No Go the Bogeyman</em>. She lives in London.<br><br>"[A] piercing, playful use of ideas.... Warner moves with a high-wire walker's assurance, from Ovid, Bosch and Dante to James Hogg's 'Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner,' Stevenson's 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde' and on to Nabokov's 'Lolita' and even Philip Pullman's 'His Dark Materials.' In addition, she makes several seductive moves toward that enormous threat to intellectual history, the movies.... Especially when looking at Bosch, Warner sees something like fluency in the rampant, exhilarating way forms can find new shapes. This is Warner at her playful best."--<em>The</em> <em>New York Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"In this typically agile meditation, [Warner] rewardingly charts shifting images of the imagination itself.... What makes <em>Fantastic Metamorphoses</em> remarkable is its dashing investigation of imagination."--<em>The Observer</em><p></p><br>"Rules of thumb: (1) genuinely scholarly books are no delight to read, and (2) "antiquarian" studies do not illuminate the life and culture of (post)modern readers. Exception: <em>Fantastic Metamorphoses, Other Worlds</em>.... This irresistibly styled and splendidly illustrated treatment of generation, evolution, growth, and decay touches most of the mythological--and many of the literary-artistic--bases, but goes beyond them to encompass photography, cultural anthropology, folklore, and lepidoptery."--<em>Virginia Quarterly Review</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Anthropology Graduate&#39;s Guide: From Student to a Career</h2><p>Mom will ask, &#x201c;What can you do with a degree in anthropology?&#x201d; If you want the answer, then you need this book.

Silas hoards a treasure that kills his spirit until fate steals it from him and replaces it with a golden-haired founding child. Where she came from, who her parents were, and who really stole the gold are the secrets that permeate this moving tale of guilt and innocence. A moral allegory of the redemptive power of love, it is also a finely drawn picture of early nineteenth-century England in the days when spinning wheels hummed busily in the farmhouses, and of a simple way of life that was soon to disappear.</p><p>Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

It is more nearly a masterpiece; it has more of that simple, rounded, consummate aspect. . .which marks a classical work." -- Henry James</p><h2>After the End of Art</h2><p><p>Over a decade ago, Arthur Danto announced that art ended in the sixties. Ever since this declaration, he has been at the forefront of a radical critique of the nature of art in our time. <i>After the End of Art</i> presents Danto's first full-scale reformulation of his original insight, showing how, with the eclipse of abstract expressionism, art has deviated irrevocably from the narrative course that Vasari helped define for it in the Renaissance. Moreover, he leads the way to a new type of criticism that can help us understand art in a posthistorical age where, for example, an artist can produce a work in the style of Rembrandt to create a visual pun, and where traditional theories cannot explain the difference between Andy Warhol's Brillo Box and the product found in the grocery store. Here we are engaged in a series of insightful and entertaining conversations on the most relevant aesthetic and philosophical issues of art, conducted by an especially acute observer of the art scene today.</p><br><p> Originally delivered as the prestigious Mellon Lectures on the Fine Arts, these writings cover art history, pop art, "people's art," the future role of museums, and the critical contributions of Clement Greenberg--who helped make sense of modernism for viewers over two generations ago through an aesthetics-based criticism. Tracing art history from a mimetic tradition (the idea that art was a progressively more adequate representation of reality) through the modern era of manifestos (when art was defined by the artist's philosophy), Danto shows that it wasn't until the invention of Pop art that the historical understanding of the means and ends of art was nullified. Even modernist art, which tried to break with the past by questioning the ways of producing art, hinged on a narrative.</p><br><p> Traditional notions of aesthetics can no longer apply to contemporary art, argues Danto. Instead he focuses on a philosophy of art criticism that can deal with perhaps the most perplexing feature of contemporary art: that everything is possible.</p></p><p>Art is still dead, according to Arthur Danto, professor at Columbia University and art critic for <i>The Nation</i>. <i>After the End of Art: Contemporary Art and the Pale of History</i> is a collection of Danto's 1995 Mellon Lectures on the Fine Arts. Famous for his radical critiques of the nature of art--he dates the death of art to around 1964 and declares the art museum has replaced the church for the masses--Danto continues to question traditional notions of aesthetics and philosophy in regard to contemporary art. While touching on a variety of art-related topics, the focus of tehse lectures remains the deviation of contemporary art from the great narrative that has defined art throughout history.<b>Arthur C. Danto</b>, Johnsonian Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at Columbia University, is Art Critic for <i>The Nation</i>.

Kleege&#x2019;s absorption with Keller originated as an angry response to the ideal of a secular saint, which no real blind or deaf person could ever emulate. However, her investigation into the genuine person revealed that a much more complex set of characters and circumstances shaped Keller&#x2019;s life.<br><br><i>Blind Rage</i> employs an adroit form of creative nonfiction to review the critical junctures in Keller&#x2019;s life. The simple facts about Helen Keller are well-known: how Anne Sullivan taught her deaf-blind pupil to communicate and learn; her impressive career as a Radcliffe graduate and author; her countless public appearances in various venues, from cinema to vaudeville, to campaigns for the American Foundation for the Blind. But Kleege delves below the surface to question the perfection of this image. Through the device of her letters, she challenges Keller to reveal her actual emotions, the real nature of her long relationship with Sullivan, with Sullivan&#x2019;s husband, and her brief engagement to Peter Fagan. Kleege&#x2019;s imaginative dramatization, distinguished by her depiction of Keller&#x2019;s command of abstract sensations, gradually shifts in perspective from anger to admiration. <i>Blind Rage</i> criticizes the Helen Keller myth for prolonging an unrealistic model for blind people, yet it appreciates the individual who found a practical way to live despite the restrictions of her myth.</p></p><p><p><b>Georgina Kleege</b> is Assistant Professor of English at the University of California, Berkeley, CA.</p><p>from Part One:<br>Consciousness on Trial<br><br>February 3<br><br>Dear Helen Keller:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow me to introduce myself. I am a writer and part-time English professor. I am American, married, middle-aged, middle class. Like you, I am blind, though not deaf. But the most important thing you need to know about me, and the reason for my letter, is that I grew up hating you. Sorry to be so blunt, especially on such short acquaintance, but one of the advantages of writing to a dead person is there&#x2019;s no need to stand on ceremony. And you should know the truth from the start. I hated you because you were always held up to me as a role model, and one who set such an impossibly high standard of cheerfulness in the face of adversity. &#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t you be more like Helen Keller?&#x201d; people always said to me. Or that&#x2019;s what it felt like whenever your name came up. &#x201c;Count your blessings,&#x201d; they told me. &#x201c;Yes, you&#x2019;re blind, but poor little Helen Keller was blind and deaf, and no one ever heard her complain.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not alone in this. Many disabled people think you did our cause a lot of harm. Your life story inscribes the idea that disability is a personal tragedy to be overcome through an individual&#x2019;s fortitude and pluck, rather than a set of cultural practices and assumptions, affecting many individuals that could be changed through collective action. Lately, for reasons I can&#x2019;t entirely explain, my feelings about you have mellowed. It occurred to me that I should not hold you responsible for the use others made of your life story. This led me to dip into your autobiographical writing for the first time. Even more surprising, it led me to take a road trip to visit your childhood home, Ivy Green, in Tuscumbia, Alabama. And I thought you&#x2019;d like to know what I found there.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went with my husband Nick who is almost always up for a road trip. We took the house tour, which was standard fare for a local-hero museum. The guide was a woman pushing sixty, probably a volunteer, apparently reciting a script. She rattled off a number of facts about the town, the region, and antebellum architecture&#x2014;all the predictable stuff.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, in one of the downstairs rooms, she pointed out a carpet on the floor that had been woven especially for you by I forget whom. She explained all this, then said, &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it lovely?&#x201d; We murmured agreement. Then she said, &#x201c;Too bad Helen Keller never saw it.&#x201d; Her voice had a throaty throb as she delivered the line. I realized that the statement was supposed to catch us up short, jar us out of our complacency, remind us that you were deaf and blind. We were supposed to feel grateful and lucky, and intone a private prayer of gratitude: &#x201c;I wake each day and thank the Lord I was not born Helen Keller.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should have expected nothing less. Where better to deliver the &#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t you be more like Helen Keller&#x201d; message than in your childhood home? I should have steeled myself against it, but the resentment I feel about the message is so old and deep, it&#x2019;s like a knee-jerk reflex. And on this occasion, I turned my resentment on the woman pointing out the carpet that poor little you never saw. I said, &#x201c;But she could touch it.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What?&#x201d; the guide said. &#x201c;She what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She could touch it,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;She had the sense of touch. One of the pleasures of a nice carpet is texture. She could feel it. She could walk on it barefoot. She had an imagination. Someone could describe it to her, and she could imagine it.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was talking like a crank. There&#x2019;s a certain vibration that comes into a person&#x2019;s voice when they&#x2019;re going off the deep end, and I had it. I could feel the guide eyeing me askance. Was this how I was going to be? I was spoiling her spiel. I could feel the rest of the tour group&#x2014;a van load of Baptists from Tennessee&#x2014;looking away.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, I quieted down and we moved on. I felt the guide was leery of me. As she pointed out the pump organ in the parlor, she paused briefly. I sensed she was supposed to say something about how you never heard its beautiful music, but since she had a crank in the crowd today, she dropped the line.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we surveyed each room from the doorway, our guide was at pains to tell us which pieces of furniture actually belonged to your family, which were of the period, and which were merely reproductions. I&#x2019;ve been on enough such house tours to know authenticity is always an issue. I wished she would let me walk around the rooms and touch something. This was not the most blind-friendly museum I&#x2019;ve ever visited. At Louis Braille&#x2019;s house in France, they let you put your hands on anything that&#x2019;s not in a case. But perhaps fewer blind people visit your house.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As if to confirm this, our guide spent a lot of time talking about the photographs on the walls of the central hallway. Although I have some residual vision, I don&#x2019;t see photographs well. Nick told me what I was looking at and read me the labels. There was one of you at about age seven, around the time Anne Sullivan, your teacher, came into your life. The guide said, &#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t she a lovely child?&#x201d; Then she shook her head. To be accurate, I don&#x2019;t know if she shook her head or not. But her tone was that of someone shaking her head at the waste of it all. As if it would be less tragic if you had been homely.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I swallowed the urge to make this comment aloud. I am so used to this attitude, it hardly even registers anymore. &#x201c;What a pretty girl,&#x201d; people say. &#x201c;Too bad she&#x2019;s blind.&#x201d; Apparently, beauty is wasted on us because we can&#x2019;t see the reflection in the mirror, can&#x2019;t see men&#x2019;s heads turn when we enter a room. In this picture, you&#x2019;re wearing a dress with a lot of ruffles, and your hair is an elaborate arrangement of ringlets. Do you look pretty? Nick told me that there&#x2019;s a certain set to your lower lip, which makes it sound like your expression must be at odds with the prettiness of your dress and hair. He said you look posed and a bit uncertain about it. What could a photograph mean to you at that age? Later, you got the hang of it. In other photographs around the place, you&#x2019;re always wearing a big smile and have your eyes aimed directly at the lens.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next to this photo, there was one of Anne Sullivan&#x2014;&#x201c;Teacher,&#x201d; as you always called her&#x2014;taken at about the same time. The guide said, &#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t she pretty?&#x201d; with that same &#x201c;such a pity&#x201d; tone. Only the pity in her case is not that she was blind or deaf or anything else. The pity in her case is that she sacrificed her life to be your companion and helpmate, when she was pretty enough to get herself a man and have a normal life. Again, I could have argued otherwise. But I didn&#x2019;t.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Is she pretty?&#x201d; I asked Nick. He told me she was intense looking, at once frail and fiery. I have no idea what that looks like, but the description fits what I know about her personality, so I took him at his word.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Up until this point, the house tour followed the predictable course. Yes, there was that crack about the carpet, but I admit most people probably wouldn&#x2019;t have noticed it. But once we got to the dining room, things got strange. The guide called it the &#x201c;famous dining room&#x201d; where all your &#x201c;famous battles took place.&#x201d; She called you &#x201c;a regular little hellion,&#x201d; and narrated the struggle Teacher had getting you to eat with a fork and fold your napkin. As she was talking, I realized suddenly that she took <i>The Miracle Worker</i> as gospel. Outside the house, we found &#x201c;the famous pump house,&#x201d; a sort of fenced-in gazebo around the famous pump that is the central prop in the climatic scene of that play. But the ultimate weirdness was farther back, behind some outbuildings, where there was a permanent stage set and bleachers. There, in the summer, they stage nightly performances of <i>The Miracle Worker.</i><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is where I began to articulate something, Helen. Mind if I call you Helen? My problem with all this, Helen, is not that the play is inaccurate. The playwright William Gibson drew those scenes from the letters and journals Teacher kept during her first few weeks at Ivy Green. In fact, as the play depicts, one day at the end of March 1887, Teacher pumped water over one of your hands while spelling the word <i>water</i> into your other, and you suddenly, miraculously, discovered language. You dropped the mug you&#x2019;d been holding, said &#x201c;wa-wa,&#x201d; a baby-talk word you&#x2019;d retained from before the illness that left you deaf and blind. Then you went on to learn to communicate with the manual alphabet, to read, to write, to speak, and generally to triumph over adversity in all the laudable ways that made you famous.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part of what disturbed me was not that this event was enshrined in your home, but that it is re-enacted there. Where else in the world are events from a person&#x2019;s life ritualistically recreated in this way? Jerusalem springs to mind, The Way of the Cross. And while you may find the impulse to beatify, even deify you, flattering, it comes at such a high cost, Helen, particularly for the generations of disabled people who follow you.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the main thing that disturbed me as I walked around the stage in your backyard was that <i>The Miracle Worker</i> is Teacher&#x2019;s story, not yours. <i>She</i> was the one who worked the miracle and triumphed over adversity. <i>You</i> were the adversity she overcame. You were the site of miracles. And while I admire Teacher&#x2019;s accomplishment, the play distorts things a little.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You were, in part, responsible for this. Throughout your life, you were always quick to give Teacher the lion&#x2019;s share of credit for your education. And you narrated the same events&#x2014;the dining room battles, the pump scene&#x2014;in your own memoirs.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I went to your house to find something else, another story. As we walked around the stage and back to the house, I scuffed the ground to raise a dust. I inhaled it. I guess I was hoping there might still be a few molecules of you left there, the you before language, the pre-Teacher you. I wanted to feel you there somewhere. I imagined you, age five or six, crouching in the shadows under the back steps. Your hair was a wad of tangles. Your face and hands were sticky with some sweet you filched from the pantry. Your pinafore was crumpled and stained. Your feet were shoeless, caked with mud. As I conjured your presence, I felt energy emanating from you which was both curious and hostile. But not fearful, never fearful. I knew that if I bent down to touch you, you would catch hold of my hand. Your touch would not be gentle. You would smear your hand around my face to check if I was someone you knew. You would pat my pockets, looking for candy. Finding none, you might thrust my hand away, slapping at me, kicking at my legs with your calloused heels. Then you would scramble away from me, scoot backward into the darkness.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>That</i> was the child I went there to find, not the &#x201c;lovely child&#x201d; of the photographs, the paragon of cheerfulness and industry. In your adult writings when you attempted to recreate your pre-linguistic experiences, you called that child &#x201c;Phantom.&#x201d; I wish you&#x2019;d found a different name. Phantom is too ghostly, too wispy, when my sense of that child is solidly corporeal, a dense tangle of physical needs and desires. And that child had a language of sorts. Before Teacher came, you were able to communicate with gestures and signs, some of them quite elaborate. You had signs for every member of your family, all the servants, and the regular visitors to your home. Your sign for your mother was to pat your cheek. Your sign for your favorite aunt was to tie imaginary bonnet strings under your chin. Your sign for your father was to put on imaginary eyeglasses and read an imaginary newspaper. And you had signs for things as well, typically food, since as for most young children, food loomed large in your concerns. If you wanted bread and butter, you would saw at the air with the edge of your hand then make deft buttering motions with your finger. If you wanted ice cream, you would turn the crank of an imaginary freezer, then hug yourself and shiver. The people around you understood these signs and could generally give you what you wanted. The problem was that your system was not particularly versatile or flexible. In effect, you could say, &#x201c;I want . . . ,&#x201d; but could not communicate anything more nuanced. And no one could use your signs to communicate back to you.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I may be wrong to call this gestural system of yours a language. It is perhaps no more a language than the way pets communicate with their people. For instance, one of my cats is currently sitting on the floor and meowing at me because she wants to be fed. When I don&#x2019;t respond, she will jump up on my desk and pace back and forth in front of my keyboard until I give in and go into the kitchen to fill her dish. Because I do this, she will repeat these actions anytime she wants to be fed. But this is not really language. I cannot use these same behaviors to communicate anything back to her. And besides, I know you never liked any comparison between your experiences and those of animals. And you were right. Such analogies coincide too neatly with ancient prejudices some seeing-hearing people still hold about us &#x201c;sense cripples,&#x201d; as you called people like us. Our reliance on the less elite senses&#x2014;smell, taste, and touch&#x2014;seems to drop us a few rungs on the evolutionary ladder.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But my point is, you understood something about language even before Teacher came. You knew that other people communicated using their mouths. You were in the habit of touching people&#x2019;s faces to feel their expressions, and you observed how their mouths moved, how their lips puckered and stretched, and how they emitted small puffs of warm breath. You imitated this, walking around the house flapping your jaws at anyone you met, occasionally making noises.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What happened to that child? I wanted to know. In <i>The Miracle Worker,</i> the story you helped to inscribe on the American collective memory, Teacher came to tame that child and turn her into the &#x201c;lovely child&#x201d; with all the ruffles and ringlets. At the pump, she baptized you in the font of knowledge, washing away the sin of ignorance. I recognize that this formula makes for a dramatic scene, and fits already established narrative patterns, but it oversimplifies the facts. <i>Water</i> was not the first word you learned. You picked up on the fingerspelling trick almost from the first day. What happened at the pump was something more subtle. The pump incident served to clarify the confusion you were having about container and contents. You had been confusing <i>mug</i> with <i>milk,</i> and Teacher wanted to show you that a mug could contain other liquids&#x2014;water (who knows what she would have tried next) coffee, or chicken soup. The pump moment was less a miraculous revelation than a shifting of gears, all...</p></p><h2>A Pelican at Blandings: (Blandings Castle) (Blandings Castle, 1)</h2><p><i>A Blandings novel</i><br><i></i><br>Unwelcome guests are descending on Blandings Castle - particularly the overbearing Duke of Dunstable, who settles in the Garden Suite with no intention of leaving, and Lady Constance, Lord Emsworth's sister and a lady of firm disposition, who arrives unexpectedly from New York.

They lived a paradox--unwanted by a repressive Stalinist state, yet forbidden to leave. <i>When They Come for Us, We'll Be Gone</i> is the astonishing and inspiring story of their rescue. <p></p> Journalist Gal Beckerman draws on newly released Soviet government documents as well as hundreds of oral interviews with refuseniks, activists, Zionist "hooligans," and Congressional staffers. He shows not only how the movement led to a mass exodus in 1989, but also how it shaped the American Jewish community, giving it a renewed sense of spiritual purpose and teaching it to flex its political muscle. He also makes a convincing case that the movement put human rights at the center of American foreign policy for the very first time, helping to end the Cold War. <p></p> In cinematic detail, the book introduces us to all the major players, from the flamboyant Meir Kahane, head of the paramilitary Jewish Defense League, to Soviet refusenik Natan Sharansky, who labored in a Siberian prison camp for over a decade, to Lynn Singer, the small, fiery Long Island housewife who went from organizing local rallies to strong-arming Soviet diplomats. This multi-generational saga, filled with suspense and packed with revelations, provides an essential missing piece of Cold War and Jewish history. <br> <br> <br> <p> <b>Amazon Exclusive Essay from Gal Beckerman, Author of <i>When They Come for Us, We'll Be Gone</i></b> </p> <p>In the summer of 2006, I traveled to Moscow, St. Petersburg and Riga. I needed to see the places I was writing about in the book, even though no activists or refuseniks lived there any more. All my characters were long gone--the story itself was about their fight to leave. So besides talking with a few former dissidents and some Russian Jews who had stayed, it was mostly just a chance to get a better feel for the lost world in which my book takes place.</p> <p>And so I found myself standing outside the refusenik Volodya Slepak's apartment on what was once Gorky Street, now Tsverskaya. I stared up at the balcony where he and his wife Masha defiantly and illegally unfurled a banner in June 1978, demanding that they be allowed to join their son in Israel (he was one of the few who had managed to leave). Hundreds of people clogged Gorky Street and jeered at them. Eventually they were arrested and sentenced to three years of Siberian exile. The street had obviously changed. There were now flashing lights, expensive stores, and half-naked women on billboards. But it didn&#x2019;t take too much of a leap to picture the stately slate-gray building and the wide boulevard as it once was.</p> <p>Many times on that trip, I realized that all I had to do was mentally remove two or three elements from whatever landscape I was looking at, and I could imagine the place as it was. Occasionally, I would call refuseniks now living in Israel and ask them to describe over the phone some episode from their life and where it had taken place--a square where a protest was held or the government office where they were finally handed an exit visa after a dozen years of being denied. Except for a few changed street names, they could usually describe everything about a given location. The past, I understood, was still fresh. Somehow it made the history that much more powerful--to think that not so long ago these things happened here, that good people were arrested for nothing.</p> <p>One place that definitely hadn't changed was Rumbuli, where the book begins. It was here, in 1963, that a group of Jews from Riga organized themselves to clean up and consecrate the ground where a massacre of tens of thousands had taken place during World War II. This act--of coming together as a community to remember--signaled the start of the Soviet Jewry movement. Underneath a canopy of tall birch trees, the place was solemn and felt sacred. It was not hard to imagine how those Jews could have been moved to action by the knowledge of all those buried beneath them. You couldn't help but be affected by it. This was the kind of emotional motivation that was simply impossible to understand from a distance. I needed to stand on that earth, too.</p> <i>-Gal Beckerman</i> <p>(Photo � Nina Subin)</p> <br> <br> <p> <b>Photographs from <i>When They Come for Us, We'll Be Gone</i></b><br> <b>(Click on images to enlarge)</b> </p><p></p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>June 1964, a week-long interfaith fast takes place in front of the Soviet mission in Manhattan.</td> <td>The movement inspired some striking poster art, including this 1969 design by Israeli artist Dan Reisinger.</td> <td>An iconic photo of the most famous refusenik activists, taken in 1976.</td> <td>1978 gathering--Leonid Volvovsky, who was later imprisoned for his activities, is at the microphone.</td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1981--Yuli Kosharovsky with his wife and baby.

What made Soviet Jews so much worse off than other people living in the totalitarian state?<p></p> <b>A:</b> I get this question a lot and it's important to answer. First, Jews have always occupied a strange place in the Russian psyche, often perceived as parasites or fifth columnists, the constant outsiders. They were never allowed to completely assimilate and at times of upheaval became convenient scapegoats--a situation that did not change even after the Bolsheviks created a socialist "paradise." But the other, more crucial distinction is that unlike Ukrainians or Latvians or any other "national" group in the Soviet Union, Jews had no indigenous land they could go to where they could speak their language and express their identity. Israel was the only option. Once a new self-awareness among Jews started to catch on in the early 1960s, they tried at first to imagine opening up a space of cultural and religious life for themselves within the Soviet Union. When it was clear that even this threatened the authorities, they turned their sights toward emigration. Thus, a movement.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> Is there any relevance today to this story? Any modern parallels?<p></p> <b>A:</b> The story is still very relevant, and not only because Russia is behaving more and more like the old Soviet state in its suppression of dissent. One of the big questions the book poses is how a country like the United States balances its national security interests with moral imperatives. Soviet Jewry very much introduced this tension into the Cold War, turning it into a conflict that was about more than just who had how many missiles. This balance still poses incredible challenges for the United States. Take the case of China. On the one hand, the expansion of relations since the 1970s has had great economic benefits, but it has been accompanied by a deep undercurrent of discomfort about the censorship and repression that allows China&#x2019;s nominally Communist authorities to stay in power. Iran is an even more dramatic example. The issue of how much and how publicly to support the growing democracy movement while also trying to stop their nuclear program strongly echoes debates from the 1970s surrounding Soviet Jews. <p></p> <b>Q:</b> What kind of research did you have to do?<p></p> <b>A:</b> Since there really wasn't much primary material on the Soviet side of the story, I had to conduct many interviews. I spoke to over two hundred people for the book, mostly in Israel, the United States, and Russia, sometimes for hours, sitting in their living rooms over cups of tea or--often--glasses of vodka and plates of pickled mushrooms. Many of these people felt like they had been forgotten. When I arrived in their homes with my tape recorder, they were only too happy to share the part they felt they had played in history. Also crucial for telling the Soviet side were documents uncovered by an Israeli researcher that gave a view into how the Kremlin saw their "Jewish problem." It was quite an experience to read the transcript of a politburo meeting in which Leonid Brezhnev suddenly says, "Zionism is making us stupid..." For the American side, it was much more straightforward: huge and largely untouched archives exist for the two largest organizations dealing with Soviet Jewry.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> What was the most dramatic part of the story?<p></p> <b>A:</b> Just in terms of heart-racing plot, nothing can really beat the episode of the Leningrad hijacking. This was the story of a group of Soviet Jews who tried to hijack a plane and fly it out of the Soviet Union. At some point they were sure they would get caught but continued anyway with the hope that even if they were arrested or killed, this was the best way to reveal their cause to the rest of the world. I interviewed most of the plotters and even spent the thirty-fifth anniversary of the hijacking with them at a BBQ cookout in Israel. This allowed me to describe in great detail the tick-tock leading up to the moment, on the tarmac, when they were tackled to the ground and taken into custody. What happened afterward was pretty remarkable as well. The Soviets put on a show trial and sentenced the two leaders to death. But there was such a world outcry in response that the death sentences were commuted.<p></p> <br> <br>Gal Beckerman is a reporter at the Forward.

Koch and Farrell, experienced teachers as well as poets, write about poetry in such a way that students will find it accessible and interesting. The book includes selections of poetry by twenty-three poets, among them Dickinson, Hopkins, Pound, Williams and Eliot, as well as Ginsberg, O&#39;Hara, Baraka and Ashbery. There is also the translated work of such modern European poets such as Lorca, Rilke, Rimbaud, Apollinaire and Mayakowsky.</p><p><b>Kenneth Koch</b> has published many volumes of poetry, including <i>New Addresses, Straits</i> and <i>One Train</i>. He was awarded the Bollingen Prize for Poetry in 1995, in 1996 he received the Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt National Prize for Poetry awarded by the Library of Congress, and he received the first Phi Beta Kappa Poetry award in November of 2001. His short plays, many of them produced off- and off-off-Broadway, are collected in <i>The Gold Standard: A Book of Plays.</i> He has also written several books about poetry, including <i>Wishes, Lies, and Dreams; Rose, Where Did You Get That Red?;</i> and, most recently, <i>Making Your Own Days: The Pleasures of Reading and Writing Poetry</i>. He taught undergraduates at Columbia University for many years. He passed away in 2002. <br><br><b>Kate Farrell</b> began collaborating with Kenneth Koch while still his student at Columbia University, working as his fellow teacher in the Nursing Home project on which his book <i>I Never Told Anybody</i> is based. After graduating, she taught poetry in high schools in the NY State Poets in the Schools Program, a key inspiration for <i>Sleeping on the Wing. </i>Koch and Farrell also co-authored <i>Talking to the Sun</i>, an anthology for young people, illustrated by works from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Farrell went on to assemble four more anthologies of poetry matched with art for the Metropolitan Museum and the National Gallery. She has taught imaginative writing at Columbia University and her poetry has appeared in many journals, including <i>Poetry, Partisan Review, Hudson Review</i> and <i>Harvard Review. </i>Her work was also chosen for three recent editions of <i>The Best Spiritual Writing</i> series.<b>From the introduction<br></b><br>READING POETRY<br><br>The experience you get from reading poetry is not exactly like any other. Sometimes poetry gives the impression of saying more than words can say. This mysterious-seeming effect is caused by the fact that in poetry words are used in a way that is different from the way words are usually used. Poetry is art, and so has a different purpose from that of the regular way of talking and writing, and has a different effect.<br><br>Most of the difficulties that people have in reading poetry come from their not understanding this. It is easier to understand using a rock to make sculpture, or sound to make music, than it is to understand using words to make poetry. Words already have meanings and ways of being put together to get something across. So, when you read words, it is natural to expect the ordinary kind of intellectual sense that you are used to, a kind of sense you don't expect, for instance, when you listen to music. Once you understand what poetry is and how it is different from other writing, it won't seem to you so confusing and difficult.<br><br>Usually when you talk or write, you start with an idea, then try to express it in words and in a style that will make it clear to the people you are talking or writing to. Sometimes that's easy. You say, "I would like a glass of water." Sometimes it's hard. Talking about strong or complicated feelings -- about being in love, for instance, or feeling sad -- you may end up with a feeling that you haven't really said what you meant, that there isn't any way to put what you feel into words. The more personal the thing that you want to say, and the more particular it is to your own way of thinking and feeling and seeing things, the less likely it is that you can express it with the ordinary way of talking.<br><br>Suppose you decide to find a way of talking in which you can express perfectly your own sense of things, your thought or way of seeing, or your own particular experience. And that it becomes more important to you to get those things right than to make sure somebody else understands them. Suppose you want to get an experience into words so that it is permanently there, as it would be in a painting -- so that every time you read what you wrote, you reexperienced it. Suppose you want to say something so that it is right and beautiful -- even though you may not understand exactly why. Or suppose words excite you -- the way stone excites a sculptor -- and inspire you to use them in a new way. And that for these or other reasons you like writing because of the way it makes you think or because of what it helps you to understand. These are some of the reasons poets write poetry.<br><br>It doesn't make sense to read poetry the way you read a newspaper article. It is good, in general, to read a poem with the kind of freedom, openness and sensitive attentiveness to your own thought and feelings that you have when you write a poem yourself or when you listen to a friend talking or when you ear music. You understand the meaning of the words in the poem with your intellect, but you also respond to the poem with a part of your intelligence that includes your feelings and imagination and experience.<br><br>You can like a poem before you understand it, and be moved by it, and in fact, that is a sign that you're starting to understand it, that you're reading the poem in a good way. Being moved by a poem -- laughing or feeling sad or full of longing -- or being excited by it, or feeling (maybe you don't know why) the "rightness" of the poem is a serious part of reading and liking poetry. You may find what you read to be beautiful, or be reminded of places and times, or find in it another way to look at things. All this can help you to understand the poem because it brings it closer to you, makes it a part of your experience. And the better you understand a good poem, the more you'll like it.<br><br>The best way to begin is by reading the poem several times to get used to the style. After you get a sense of the whole poem, there are some things you can do to help yourself understand anything that's unclear, which often it won't be. There may be a word or two you don't understand, or a reference to a person or a place that you're not familiar with. These you can look up in a dictionary or encyclopedia or ask someone about. There may be a sentence that's so long it's hard to follow, or a sentence that's left incomplete; words may be in a unusual order, or a sentence hard to see because it's divided into different lines. For these problems, just go through the poem slowly, seeing where the different sentences begin and end. If you understand part of a poem and not another part, try to use what you do understand to help you see what the rest means.<br><br>If the poem still seems hard to you, it may be because you're looking for something that isn't there. You may think that the poem makes a point, that it comes to some conclusion about life in general, when the point may only be to get into the poem the look of a locust tree in the early spring. Or you may be looking for a hidden meaning that isn't there. The suggestiveness of poetry often means that people think there is one specific hidden meaning. There isn't one. A good poem means just what it says, and it suggests what it suggests. The search for deep meanings behind what is said is usually painful and unrewarding. Poems don't usually have hidden meanings. One main trouble with "finding" such meaning when they're not really there is that they end up hiding what really is there. One of Wallace Stevens's poems begins <br><br>The houses are haunted<br>By white nightgowns.<br><br>He means, in fact, as you realize after you read the poems a few times and get to know it, that people are wearing conservative white night clothes which make them look like ghosts. It's a witty way of making fun of them for being so conservative and dull. If you start off looking for hidden meanings, however, you may never know this. You may start thinking of a supernatural phenomenon, of real ghosts, maybe even of Lazarus and his rising from the grace, and you'll lose the poem completely. It's like looking for the real meaning behind a sailboat race on the bay. You'll probably miss the beauty and excitement of the boats, the water, the sky, the day. Remember (writing poems of your own will help you to know it) that poets are not big, dark, heavy personages dwelling in clouds of mystery, but people like yourself who are doing what they like to do and do well. Writing poetry isn't nay more mysterious than what a dancer or a singer or a painter does. If a poet writes well, what he says is to be found in the words that are actually there, almost always in the commonest meanings.<br><br>Sometimes, too, people make the mistake of analyzing the poem word by word before they've got an idea of what the whole poem is like. This seems scholarly and scientific but is as misleading as analyzing each of a person's words in a conversation before you know who he is and what he is talking about. Better than starting right in to analyze according to some already existing idea is to think of how the poem is affecting you, think of your own responses to it. Also, when first reading a poem, you don't have to be concerned with its technique, with how it is made -- that is to say, its rhyme, its meter, its imagery, and so on. That can be interesting to talk or write about later, but when you're first reading a poem you don't need to do it. <br><br>Even when they don't know much about poetry, people sometimes have strong ideas about what poetry ought to be like. This can keep them from enjoying all the different ways poetry can be. If you read poetry expecting it to be always the same, you will be confused. It is an art, like music or painting, with all kinds of possible variations.<br><br>Everything you like about a poem will be enhanced, and what you understand of it will be increased, by reading other poems by the same poet. As you get used to a poet's style and so on, you can hear everything in his poems more clearly. If you don't feel intimidated, understanding or figuring things out can be enjoyable in itself. Think of the rather pleasant process of figuring out a part of town you've never been in or an interesting person you've just met.<br><br>When you read a poem, the poet's experience becomes, in a way, your own, so you see things and think things you wouldn't see and think otherwise. It's something like travelling -- seeing new places, hearing things talked about in new ways, getting ideas of other possibilities. It can change you a little and add to what you know and are.</p><h2>Seeing Systems</h2><p>In this extensively revised and updated edition of his classic book, Barry Oshry shows how we can transform &#x201c;system blindness&#x201d; into &#x201c;system sight,&#x201d; enabling us to live and work together in productive partnership. Based on more than thirty years of research and packed with illustrative cases and solid systems theory on human interaction, <i>Seeing Systems</i> provides a penetrating look at the dynamics of systems and a unique foundation for revolutionizing our understanding of system life. This new edition features an extensive new section on having the wisdom and courage to face and work with the reality of uncertainty, and a new epilogue describing how Oshry is currently using theater, blogs, and podcasts to extend his multi-pronged revolution aimed at transforming system blindness into system sight.</p><p>Seeing Systems is the most accessible, penetrating book available on the dynamics of systems. In it, Barry Oshry explains why so many efforts at creating more satisfying and productive systems end in disappointment, and proposes an entirely new framework for dealing with human behavior. Oshry shows us how teams of top executives regularly fall into turf battles with one another; why organizational improvement efforts inevitably create tensions between the &#34;&#34;good&#34;&#34; cooperative workers and the &#34;&#34;bad&#34;&#34; resistant ones; how marriages seemingly &#34;&#34;made in heaven&#34;&#34; disintegrate. Oshry demonstrates how these breakdowns in organizations result from our blindness to the human systems of which we are a part. Finally, he shows how powerful, productive, and satisfying partnerships are created when we are able to recognize and stop these destructive &#34;&#34;dances&#34;&#34;, and create new ones in which we understand and are respectful of one another and can work in productive partnership. Seeing Systems takes us to a whole new level of understanding ourselves as human beings.Barry Oshry is the founder of Power + Systems, Inc., developer of the Power Lab and the Organization Workshop on Creating Partnership, and the author of Leading Systems.</p><h2>Now Dig This: The Unspeakable Writings of Terry Southern, 1950-1995</h2><p>Acclaimed novelist, Beat godfather, prolific screenwriter, and one of the founders of New Journalism, as well as the only guy to wear shades on the Beatles&#39; Sgt. Pepper&#39;s cover, Terry Southern was an audacious original. Now Dig This is a journey through Terry Southern&#39;s America, from the buttoned-down &#39;50s through the sexual revolution, rock &#39;n&#39; roll, and independent cinema (which he helped inaugurate by cowriting and producing Easy Rider), up to his death in 1995. It spans Southern&#39;s stellar career, from early short stories and a Paris Review interview with Henry Green, to his legendary Esquire piece covering the 1968 Chicago Democratic Convention with Jean Genet and William Burroughs and his equally infamous account of life neck-high in girls and cocaine aboard The Rolling Stones&#39; tour jet, to his memories of twentieth-century legends like Abbie Hoffman, Kurt Vonnegut, and Stanley Kubrick, with whom he wrote Dr. Strangelove. &#34;A voice electric with street rhythm and royal with offhand intellection ... stuffed with strange and silken scraps.&#34; -- Troy Patterson, Entertainment Weekly &#34;The subterranean Texan&#39;s finest moments are exquisite reads ... like a hot poker in the eye of conventional narrative.&#34; -- A. D. Amorosi, Philadelphia City Paper &#34;The range of writing ... [was] as lethal as Mailer claimed and still awaiting the attention it deserves.&#34; -- Charles Taylor, Newsday &#34;... reveals a writer defined by his generosity, by the pursuit of fun and by an insatiable ... literary appetite....&#34; -- Claire Dederer, The New York Times Book Review</p><p>Co-editor, Nile Southern, runs the estate at TerrySouthern.comCo-editer, Josh Alan Friedman, can be found at BlackCracker.fmWith this outstanding, volatile m&#x201a;lange of short pieces, Nile Southern repositions his father "the conduit between the Beatles and the Beats" as a Class Four hurricane in the Hipster Pantheon. Labeled "the Mt. Rushmore of modern American humor" by Saturday Night Live head writer Michael O'Donoghue (who hired him), Southern (1924-1995) is best remembered for his Oscar-nominated screenplays (Easy Rider; Dr. Strangelove) and novels (Candy; The Magic Christian). He also unleashed assorted anarchic articles, reviews (in the Nation), short stories and photo captions (Virgin: A History of Virgin Records, his last book). The opening interview from 1986 is followed by four stories that animate characters via expressive, askew vernacular. Letters to Lenny Bruce and George Plimpton, plus a hilarious commentary on female orgasms mailed to Ms. in 1972, are included. The famed pie-throwing sequence deleted by Kubrick from Dr. Strangelove is described in detail in "Strangelove Outtake: Notes from the War Room." Southern's sharp Esquire piece on the 1968 Chicago police attacks on protesters remains potent. Affectionate portraits of pranksters, poets and friends Plimpton, Maurice Girodias, Burroughs, Ginsberg, Abbie Hoffman, Vonnegut, Frank O'Hara make the closing pages sparkle. Readers will be grateful to Nile Southern for unearthing Terry's "unclassifiable schools of literary invention" from mini-storage for this variegated, entertaining book.

In <em>Union Made</em>, Heath W. Carter advances a bold new interpretation of the origins of American Social Christianity. While historians have often attributed the rise of the Social Gospel to middle-class ministers, seminary professors, and social reformers, this book places working people at the very center of the story. The major characters--blacksmiths, glove makers, teamsters, printers, and the like--have been mostly forgotten, but as Carter convincingly argues, their collective contribution to American Social Christianity was no less significant than that of Walter Rauschenbusch or Jane Addams. <br><br>Leading readers into the thick of late-19th-century Chicago's tumultuous history, Carter shows that countless working-class believers participated in the heated debates over the implications of Christianity for industrializing society, often with as much fervor as they did in other contests over wages and the length of the workday. The city's trade unionists, socialists, and anarchists advanced theological critiques of laissez faire capitalism and protested "scab ministers" who cozied up to the business elite. Their criticisms compounded church leaders' anxieties about losing the poor, such that by the turn-of-the-century many leading Christians were arguing that the only way to salvage hopes of a Christian America was for the churches to soften their position on "the labor question." As denomination after denomination did just that, it became apparent that the Social Gospel was, indeed, ascendant--from below.<br><br>At a time when the fate of the labor movement and rising economic inequality are once more pressing social concerns, <em>Union Made </em>opens the door for a new way forward--by changing the way we think about the past.<br></p><p><br><strong>Heath W. Carter is an associate professor at Valparaiso University, where he teaches a variety of courses on the history of the modern United States. He is co-editor of both </strong><strong><em>The Pew and the Picket Line: Christianity and the American Working Clas</em></strong><strong>s and </strong><strong><em>Turning Points in the History of American</em></strong> <strong></strong><strong><em>Evangelicalism</em></strong><strong>.</strong><br><br>"More than an important contribution to understandings of religion and the labor movement, the book also challenges interpretations of the Progressive Era by arguing that the Social Gospelwidely accepted as the creation of middle-class ministers was in fact inspired by working people who had developed their own vision of Christianity a generation earlier .Written in a style sophisticated enough for the scholar yet accessible enough for the advanced undergraduate, this book is a must read for students of labor, religious, Gilded Age, and Progressive Era history."--Evelyn Sterne, <em>History</em> <em>of Religions</em><p></p><br>"Carter's work offers a helpful intervention within the historiography of American religion by emphasizing the role of working-class individuals in the creation of social Christianity during this era. Such an intervention shifts perceptions away from the more paternalistic elements of the middle-class Social Gospel towards the more liberative theological claims created by working-class individuals."--Andrew Gardner, <em>Reading Religion</em><p></p><br>"<em>Pathbreaking</em> is an overused word in book notices, but in this case hardly any other one will do."--Grant Wacker, <em>Christian Century</em><p></p><br>"Animated with moral energy, <em>Union Made</em> is engagingly written and passionately argued."--<em>Sociology of Religion</em><p></p><br>"The author's respect for those 'prophets' is patent throughout the book, and he demonstrates why they deserve such respect."--<em>Journal of Ecclesiastical History</em><p></p><br>"[A] highly readable narrative...The book's strengths lie in clear, narrative prose that belies the enormous primary and secondary research the book required...Recommended."--<em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"Carter's strong, clear argument is based on his extensive and creative research, as well as a highly readable narrative...His narrative skillfully interweaves biographical information on key actors and situates the story in concrete places...[F]orcefully crafted and ambitiously conceived...[T]he author deserves much praise for crafting a long overdue and engaging study that interrelates working people's mobilization at the job and in union halls with their stands in the pews, and for relating those activities with some of the great challenges faced by Gilded Age America."--<em>American</em> <em>Nineteenth Century History</em><p></p><br>"[M]eticulously researched and stimulating...[Carter] argues convincingly that working people were 'at the very center of fierce fights to reconcile democracy and capitalism in the industrializing world'...His use of many interesting vignettes makes his account very lively."--<em>Journal of Illinois</em> <em>History</em><p></p><br>"A common critique in this subfield is the privileged focus it often places on mainline Protestants and on the voices of religious and labor leaders. Carter, in contrast, furthers our understanding of the complexities of the working-class religious experiences by including the detailed ideas of Catholics, women, black workers, and other non-native-born rank and file workers. By taking into account such diversity, Carter's narrative makes a tremendous contribution to the on-going scholarship in this area."--<em>American Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"Ambitious...Carter persuasively illustrates the existence of a working-class Christian discourse that predates the work of Social Gospel proponents such as Walter Rauschenbusch...[H]is book will prompt thinking about the place of working-class religion in nineteenth-century culture."--<em>Journal of</em> <em>American History</em><p></p><br>"[L]ucid and extensively documented <em>Union Made</em> is a wonderful resource for those interested in the progressive movement and the social gospel.

Social Christianity made resistance against industrial capitalism and its barons a possible and necessary thing. Combining the finest qualities of classic social, urban, and labor histories with the curiosities of our scholarly (and political) moment, <em>Union Made</em> is a sharp, much-needed reminder that American Christianity has not always been free-market in persuasion or comfortable on the corporate side. Beautifully crafted, it is also a stirring must-read." --Darren Dochuk, author of <em>From Bible Belt to Sunbelt: Plain-Folk Religion, Grassroots Politics, and the Rise of Evangelical Conservatism</em> <br><p></p><br>"Heath Carter's <em>Union Made</em> is a powerful and important book. It persuasively documents the working class origins of Social Christianity among Protestant and Catholics alike. It also makes clear that the decline of this Social Gospel tradition has left us increasingly vulnerable to the conscienceless capitalism of our own time. Reading it reminds us of what we have lost." --Jackson Lears, author of <em>Rebirth of a Nation: the Making of Modern America, 1877-1920</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Union Made</em> provides an amazing history of the battle between elite religious leaders and workers and their pastors to define the meaning of Christianity in society. Set in Chicago... Carter's deep research allows the words from pastors and labor leaders from across the city to come alive. If you care about the intersection of faith and labor, the development of the social gospel, or labor history in Chicago, this is a must read." --Kim Bobo, Founding Director, Interfaith Worker Justice <br><p></p><br>"In recovering these working-class voices, Carter makes a significant scholarly contribution to the field of American religious history while also deepening our understanding of the labor movement during the Gilded Age and Progressive Era. More than just recasting the origins of Social Christianity, he reminds us of the profound moral debates that surrounded the rise of industrial capitalism and reveals how workers campaigned for justice as forcefully and ardently within the religious sphere as they did in the political and economic arenas." -- Thomas Rzeznik, <em>The Journal of the Gilded Age and</em> <em>Progressive Era</em> <br><p></p><br>"Carter makes a signal contribution to the history of the social gospel by excavating its working-class roots."--<em>Reviews in American History</em><p></p><br>"Carter's claims are interesting and provocative. <em>Union Made</em> provides crucial insights into how many skilled workers rejected socialism or secularism in favor of a reformist Christianity that conceived of a new and more equitable cooperation between laborers and the church. As historians search for the grassroots origins of the religious right and its support of laissez-faire corporate power, it is interesting to note the existence of an earlier counternarrative that pushed urban Protestants toward liberalism and the New Deal state."--<em>Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Tyndale&#39;s Old Testament</h2><p>In the 1530s William Tyndale translated the first fourteen books of the Old Testament into English from the original Hebrew, a translation that laid the foundation of all subsequent English bibles, including the celebrated Authorized Version (King James Bible) of 1611. Tyndale was the first to translate the Hebrew Bible into English&#x2015;the first, in fact, to translate anything from Hebrew into English: At the time, that language was virtually unknown in England, and Tyndale had learned his excellent Hebrew while he was exiled to the Low Countries and Germany for political reasons. The publication of Tyndale's Old Testament, on top of his earlier and later translations of the New Testament, outraged the clerical establishment by giving the people access to the word of God in English. Tyndale was hunted down and subsequently burned at the stake for blasphemy.<br><br>Tyndale translated and printed the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Old Testament) in 1530 as a pocket book, revising Genesis in 1534. He also translated and printed the Book of Jonah, probably in 1531. In addition, there is now little doubt that after translating the Pentateuch, Tyndale went on to translate the historical books of the Old Testament&#x2015;Joshua to 2 Chronicles&#x2015;for there is overwhelming evidence that those books, as they appeared in the 1537 "Matthew's" Bible, were Tyndale's work.<br><br>The present volume contains the Pentateuch (unavailable now except in an out-of-print and unreliably edited Victorian facsimile) and the historical books, which have not been in print since 1551 and are of great importance both to scholars and to the general reader. The spelling in the texts has been modernized to show them as the modern productions they once were, and Tyndale's introductions and marginal notes are included. David Daniell's introduction explores Tyndale's astonishing achievement in single-handedly turning the Hebrew into English of great variety, force, and beauty.</p><p><b>David Daniell</b> is senior lecturer in English at University College, London.What Daniell did for Tyndale's translation of the New Testament ( LJ 2/15/90) he has now done for the latter's translation of the Old Testament (OT). In the introduction to this volume, he refers to the biographical information in the previous work, then focuses on the translation and publishing of Tyndale's OT. He offers nothing but praise for Tyndale's accomplishment, often touting his accuracy and phrasing above that of later translations. For instance, Daniell makes a case for the translation of Joshua through 2 Chronicles as being by Tyndale though it was originally attributed to Thomas Matthew. Often as interesting as the translation of the OT books themselves are Tyndale's introductions and marginal notes (primarily those accompanying the Pentateuch). In both, Tyndale finds many occasions to criticize the Catholic Church--and the pope in particular (for example, at Exodus 32:25-29, "The pope's bull slayeth more than Aaron's calf"). Any library that has Daniell's previous volume will want to add this one to its collection. Recommended for public, academic, and seminary libraries.<br><i>- Craig W.

"Such summer evenings were filled with quiet voices, dogs barking far away, the fire crackling, and often we could hear the faint drums and songs of a ceremony somewhere in the distance," writes Luci Tapahonso in this compelling collection.<br><br><i>Blue Horses Rush In</i> takes its title from a poem about the birth of her granddaughter Chamisa, whose heart "pounded quickly and we recognized / the sound of horses running: / the thundering of hooves on the desert floor." Through such personal insights, this collection follows the cycle of a woman's life and underlines what it means to be Navajo in the late twentieth century. The book marks a major accomplishment in American literature for its successful blending of Navajo cultural values and forms with the English language, while at the same time retaining the Navajo character. Here, Luci Tapahonso walks slowly through an ancient Hohokam village, recalling stories passed down from generation to generation. Later in the book, she may tell a funny story about a friend, then, within a few pages, describe family rituals like roasting green chiles or baking bread in an outside oven. Throughout, Tapahonso shares with readers her belief in the power of pollen and prayer feathers and sacred songs.<br><br> Many of these stories were originally told in Navajo, taking no longer than ten minutes in the telling. "Yet, in recreating them, it is necessary to describe the land, the sky, the light, and other details of time and place," writes Tapahonso. "In this way, I attempt to create and convey the setting for the oral text. In writing, I revisit the place or places concerned and try to bring the reader to them, thereby enabling myself and other Navajos to sojourn mentally and emotionally in our home, Din�tah."</p><p>Luci Tapahonso teaches at the University of Kansas in Lawrence.<b>Winner of the Mountains &amp; Plains Booksellers Association's 1998 Regional Book Award for Adult Nonfiction</b><br><br> "A poignant collection of stories and poems celebrating the joys and sorrows of everyday life. . . .

Why?<br><br>Because, after computer pioneers such as Alan Turing began to rediscover her, it slowly became apparent that she had been a key but overlooked figure in the invention of the computer.<br><br>In <i>Ada Lovelace</i>, James Essinger makes the case that the computer age could have started two centuries ago if Lovelace&#x2019;s contemporaries had recognized her research and fully grasped its implications.<br><br>It&#x2019;s a remarkable tale, starting with the outrageous behavior of her father, which made Ada instantly famous upon birth.

He writes about math for <i>The Guardian</i>, has a math column in <i>The Telegraph</i>, is a regular panelist on Radio 4's <i>The Infinite Monkey Cage</i>, has appeared in and worked on <i>Five Greatest</i> on the Discovery Channel, and has performed his math stand-up routines in front of audiences of thousands.</p><p><i>Zero</i></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>THE ZEROTH CHAPTER</p> <p>Have a look around you and find a drinking vessel, like a pint glass or a coffee mug. Despite appearances, almost certainly the distance around the glass will be greater than its height. Something like a pint glass may look like it is definitely taller than it is round, but a standard UK pint glass is actually around 1.8 times greater in circumference than in height. A standard &#x2018;tall&#x2019; takeaway cup from omnipresent high-street coffee shop Starbucks is actually 2.3 times further around, but yet they refuse my requests to rename it the &#x2018;squat&#x2019;.</p> <p>Using this to your advantage is easy enough: when you are next drinking in a pub, caf� or whichever drinking establishment serves the sort of beverages you enjoy getting for free, bet someone that their drinking vessel is further around than it is high. If there is a &#x2018;pot&#x2019; beer glass (the ones with handles) in the pub, or an obscenely large mug in the caf�, then you&#x2019;re sorted: they are typically three times as far around as they are tall, so you can dramatically stack three of them and claim it is still further around than up. Producing a tape measure at this point may cause your victims to question the spontaneity of the whole exercise, so use a nearby straw, or its protective paper sleeve, as a makeshift ruler.</p> <p>This works for all glasses, except for only the skinniest of champagne flutes. If you&#x2019;d like to subtly check your drinking glass without arousing suspicion, try to wrap your hand all the way around it. Your fingers and thumb will not meet on the other side. Now, with your thumb and index finger, try to span the height of the glass. You will most likely succeed (or, at worst, come very close). This is a dramatic demonstration of how much shorter glasses are than they are around.</p> <p>This is exactly the sort of maths I wish more people knew about: the surprising, the unexpected and, most importantly, the type that wins you free drinks. My goal in this book is to show people all the fun bits of mathematics. It&#x2019;s a shame that most people think maths is just what they were subjected to at secondary school: it is so much more than that.</p> <p>In the wrong situation, maths can indeed border on the tedious. Walk into a school at random in search of a maths class, and you&#x2019;ll most likely find a room where the majority of the students are <i>not</i> excited. In the least. You will shortly be asked to leave the premises, and the police may even be called. You&#x2019;re probably on some kind of list now. The point is, those students in the classroom are following in a long line of generation after generation of uninspired maths students. But there will be a few exceptions. Some of them will be loving maths and will go on to be mathematicians for the rest of their lives. What is it that they&#x2019;re enjoying which everyone else is missing?</p> <p>I was one of those students: I could see through the tedious exercises to the heart of maths, the logic behind it all. But I could sympathize with my fellow students, and specifically, the &#x2018;sporty ones&#x2019;. At school, I dreaded football drills in the same way that other people dreaded maths class. But I could see the purpose of all that messing around dribbling a football between traffic cones: you&#x2019;re building up a basic repertoire of skills so that you&#x2019;re better when it comes to an actual game of football. By the same token, I had an insight into why my sporty classmates hated maths: it&#x2019;s counterproductive to make pupils practise the basic skills needed for maths but then not let them loose into the field of mathematics to have a play around.</p> <p>That is what the maths kids knew. This is why people can make a career out of being a mathematician. If someone works in maths research, they&#x2019;re not simply doing harder and harder sums, or longer divisions, as people imagine. That would be like a professional footballer merely getting faster at dribbling up the field. A professional mathematician is using the skills they&#x2019;ve learned and the techniques they&#x2019;ve honed to explore the field of mathematics and discover new things. They might be hunting for shapes in higher dimensions, trying to find new types of numbers, or exploring a world beyond infinity. They are not just practising arithmetic.</p> <p>Herein lies the secret of mathematics: it&#x2019;s one big game. Professional mathematicians are playing. This is the goal of this book: to open up this world and give you the freedom to play with maths. You too can feel like a premier-league mathematician, and if you were already one of those kids who embraced maths, there are still plenty of new things to discover. Everything here starts with things you can really make and do. You can build a 4D object, you can dissect counter-intuitive shapes and you can tie unbelievable knots. A book is also an amazing piece of technology with a state-of-the-art pause function. If you do want to stop and play around with a bit of maths for a while, you can. The book will sit here, the words static on the page, waiting for you to return.</p> <p>All the most exciting bits of cutting-edge technology are mathematical at heart, from the number-crunching behind modern medicine to the equations that help carry text messages between mobile phones. But even technology which relies on bespoke mathematical techniques still ultimately rests on mathematics that was originally developed because a mathematician thought it would be fun to try to solve a puzzle.</p> <p>This is the essence of mathematics. It is the pursuit of pattern and logic for their own sake; it is sating our playful curiosity. New mathematical discoveries may have countless practical applications &#x2013; and we may owe our lives to them &#x2013; but that&#x2019;s rarely why they were discovered in the first place. As the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman allegedly said of his own subject: &#x2018;Physics is a lot like sex; sure it has a practical use, but that&#x2019;s not why we do it.&#x2019;</p> <p>I also hope to bring the maths you did learn at school into focus. Without it, all the other interesting bits of maths would not be within reach. Every student has vague memories of learning about the mathematical constant pi (roughly equal to 3.14), and some may recall that it is the ratio of the diameter to the circumference of a circle. It is because of pi that we know the distance around a glass is over three times greater than the distance across it. And it is the distance across which most people use when judging how big a glass is, forgetting to multiply by pi. This is more than memorizing a ratio, this is taking it for a test-run in the real world. Sadly, very little school maths focuses on how to win free drinks in a pub.</p> <p>The reason that school maths cannot be completely dismissed is that the more exciting bits of mathematics rest on the less exciting bits. This is partly why some people think maths is so hard: they&#x2019;ve missed a few vital steps along the way, and without them the higher ideas seem impossibly out of reach. But if they had tackled the subject one step at a time, in the correct order, it would have been fine.</p> <p>No one bit of mathematics is that hard to master, but sometimes it&#x2019;s important that you do things in the optimal order. Sure, getting to the top of a very high ladder may take a lot of effort from start to finish, but each individual rung is no more work to reach than the last one was. It&#x2019;s the same with mathematics. Step by step, it&#x2019;s great fun. If you understand prime numbers, then exploring prime knots is much easier. If you get to grips with 3D shapes first, then 4D shapes are not that intimidating. You can imagine all the chapters in this book as a structure, where each one rests upon several of the previous chapters.</p> <p>You can even choose your path through the chapters, as long as, before tackling a later chapter, you&#x2019;ve read all the ones that support it. As the book goes on, the chapters cover more advanced mathematics, the sorts of things you generally won&#x2019;t hear about in a classroom. This can be daunting at first glance. But as long as you pass through them in the right order, by the time you reach the far-flung corners of mathematics, you&#x2019;ll be fully equipped to enjoy all the delights and surprises there are on offer.</p> <p>Above all else, remember that the motivation for climbing this structure should be merely to enjoy the view as you go. For too long, maths has been synonymous with education; it should be about fun and exploration. One puzzle at a time, one maths game after another, and soon we&#x2019;ll be at the top, enjoying all the maths most people never know even exists. We&#x2019;ll be able to play with things beyond normal human intuition. Mathematics allows access to the world of imaginary numbers, to shapes that exist only in 196,883 dimensions, and objects beyond infinity. From the fourth dimension to transcendental numbers, we&#x2019;ll see it all.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2014 by Matt Parker</p></p><h2>Fear of Flying</h2><p>Records the erotic fantasies and outrageous adventures of Isadora Wing who travels constantly in spite of her phobia of flight</p><p>The modern classic that changed the way we thought about sex: Isadora Wing just wants to be free to find the perfect, guiltless, zipless sexual encounter, and pursues this ideal across two continents.Erica Jong is the author of nineteen books of poetry, fiction, and memoir, including <b>Fear of Flying</b>, which has more than 18 million copies in print worldwide.

When the boy tells her to "throw it away," the woman enlightens him about why worms are beneficial. She explains how to tell the head from the tail; how the worms move through the soil, helping to aerate it; how their "poop" or "cast" helps fertilize plants; what they eat; and what likes to eat them. She debunks myths about the creepy crawlies and instills in her grandson a better understanding and respect for the creatures and their importance for growing plants. In the clear and appealing pencil and gouache illustrations, the aboveground pictures show a lush vegetable and flower garden with myriad insects and birds, while belowground looks like corrugated cardboard filled with worms and their tunnels. Even the worms impart information in humorous and informative speech bubbles throughout the tale. Two pages on "How to Be a Wormologist!" close the book. Perfect for a classroom science lesson, this title will also be of interest to children learning about nature.&#x2014;<i>Maryann H.

She has woven words of protection to keep the hidden valley safe from the world and as she sings, a child lies dreaming the song down in the valley beneath. But time is passing, and Snow Leopard needs to find a singer who will follow her. But while she is searching, soldiers come looking for gold and slaves. Jackie Morris's poetic text weaves the spirit of nature into a universal myth for our time, drawing threads of transformation into a children's story glistening with wonder. Set against the stunning landscapes of the Himalayas, her superlative illustrations of the nearly-extinct Snow Leopard offer a message of hope at a time when many of the world's wildest places are being worn away by human beings.</p></p><p><b>JACKIE MORRIS</b>&nbsp;lives in Pembrokeshire, Wales, with children, dogs and cats.

The animal is a Mergichan, a "pure and powerful being" that acts as a guardian spirit. After soldiers invade the village, she infiltrates their dreams with images that make them flee so peace can return. As the sacred cat ages, she chooses a young girl to learn her secrets. Eventually the Child completes her transformation into the next protecting Snow Leopard, and the old cat blends into the Milky Way. Lush watercolors of mountain landscapes fit well with the epic, mystical premise of the tale. However, striking illustrations of snow leopards and wintry panoramas don't provide a compelling enough reason for most libraries to add this odd tale to their collections.&#x2014;<i>Kathy Piehl, Minnesota State University, Mankato</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

By the author of The Skull Mantra. 35,000 first printing.</p><p>Given the critical and commercial success of Eliot Pattison's Edgar-winning debut novel, <i>The Skull Mantra</i>, which painstakingly limned contemporary Tibet's harsh beauty and defiant fatalism through the stoic perspective of Shan Tao Yun, a Chinese bureaucrat imprisoned in a Himalayan labor camp, it's no wonder the author's second novel returns to this hauntingly scarred country. But <i>Water Touching Stone</i> also widens the author's geographical and social scope. Shan must find a killer who is stalking orphan boys in the high mountains and deserts of the Xianjiang Autonomous Region.<p> Gendun, the senior lama at the monastery that has given Shan sanctuary, announces to his student, "'You are needed in the north. A woman named Lau has been killed. A teacher. And a lama is missing.'" Though reluctant to leave the gentle presence of the monks who are balm to his crippled soul, Shan realizes he has no choice: </p><blockquote>Gendun had told him the one essential truth of the event; for the lamas everything else would be mere rumor. What they had meant was that this lama and the dead woman with a Chinese name were vital to them, and it was for Shan to discover the other truths surrounding the killing and translate them for the lamas' world.</blockquote> It turns out that Lau had taken upon herself the care of the zheli, a group of orphaned children from all corners of Xianjiang, and strove to help the children retain a sense of native identity in the face of the Poverty Eradication Scheme, which is Beijing-speak for the destruction of the herding clans and the transformation of the western steppes into a region of exploitable resources. Shan wonders whether officials from the People's Brigade (perhaps the "Jade Bitch," Prosecutor Xu Li), or the feared secret police "knobs" from Public Security decided to put a stop to her subversive activities. But when the children from the zheli begin dying amid horrific tales of the "demon" that came for them, bleak politics must grapple with darker imaginings. <p> The novel sports a practically Dickensian cast of characters, which might overwhelm the narrative by sheer numbers, yet Pattison manages to add depth to even the most minor of characters, and at the moments when the troupe threatens to become completely unwieldy, he deftly redeems the situation with moments of quiet poetry: </p><blockquote>On they went, three small men in the vastness of the changtang, the wind sweeping the grass in long waves around them, the snow-capped peaks shimmering in the brilliant light of dawn. As they appeared over a small knoll they surprised a herd of antelope, which fled across the long plain. Except one, a small animal with a broken horn, which stared as if it recognized them, then ran beside them, alone, until they reached the road.</blockquote> <i>--Kelly Flynn</i>Eliot Pattison is the author of the Edgar Award-winning <i>The Skull Mantra</i>.

She had read some of my poems and asked if I had thought of writing children's books. This is what I tell young writers: when you send your poems out into the world, you have no idea what friends they might find. Thank you, Virginia.</p><p>As a child I read all the time. I got lost and found in books, and still do. They are my refuge, escape, my endless journey. (At this moment I have fourteen books on my bedside table and forty-eight books stacked on my dresser.)</p><p>I was also fascinated by my mother's small red diary that she had kept as a girl. Her penmanship was exquisitely and perfectly slanted, a talent I did not inherit. She rarely wrote more than "Saw movie. Got new dress." I wanted to know more details. <i>What color was the dress?</i> I would beg, during our steamy afternoons as she peeled peaches for cobbler and I lay on the floor thumbing through her early life. "I have no idea!" she'd exclaim. "You think I can remember everything?"</p><p>I started keeping my own notebooks because I wanted to remember everything. The quilt, the cherry tree, the creek. The neat whop of a baseball rammed perfectly with a bat. My father's funny Palestinian stories. The feeling of breeze as my brother and I rode our bicycles down the hill. The blood-red stain of a ripe strawberry on my fingertips; the rich smell of earth at Mueller's Organic Farm a few blocks from our house.</p><p>How lucky we were to have a farm in our neighborhood! My first job was picking berries. I thought about poems as I meandered among damp rows. Thirty-four summers later my photographer- husband, Michael, our son, Madison, and I went to pick berries there again, same farm, same fields, same farmers. Suddenly everything in my life connected.</p><p>Familiar sights, sounds, smells have always been my necessities. Let someone else think about future goals and professional lives! I will keep track of the bucket and the hoe, billowing leaves, and the clouds drifting in from the horizon.</p><p>Whenever someone asks why I write about "ordinary things," I wonder, "Well, what do you have in YOUR life?" Writing saved me when my family moved to Jerusalem, my father's hometown, and during my years at Trinity University in Texas. I have spent twenty-five years working as a visiting writer with students of all ages. I write essays as well as poems, children's books and songs as well as novels and stories for teens. Material is everywhere, free as air.</p><p>Now my husband, son, and I live in a house nearly a hundred years old, a block from the little river, in downtown San Antonio. We have a large wrap-around front porch with a swing, good to read in. The most important thing to me about any room is: how are the reading lamps? The new basketball court in our backyard was finished the same week our terrific Spurs team won the 1999 NBA Championship. Sometimes things fit together! Reading and writing help us see all the many ways this is true.</p><p></p>The Family Car <i>by Tom Absher</i><br> Regrets On The Way To An Airport <i>by Ali Abunimah</i><br> Father, Herald Me Home <i>by Teresa Palomo Acosta</i><br> Nine <i>by Amy Adams</i><br> Bittersweet <i>by Lavonne J.

Some wear. Some tanning and spot to front DJ. Tiny spots to page edges. Pages are clean and binding is tight.</p><p>In tracing the history of technology in the service of war from early times to the present, van Creveld organizes this major study by epochs: the Age of Tools, the Age of Machines, the Age of Systems and the Age of Automation. Chapters within each section explore the impact of technology on particular aspects of warfaresieges, mobilization, military professionalism, command of the air, naval warfareto cite but five of 20 categories. Major military inventions from chariots to ballistic missiles, and their integration with other arms, are discussed in chronological order, along with "civilian" inventions adapted to the military realm, such as the timepiece, the telegraph, the railway. Van Creveld ( Command in War ) goes beyond the hardware to examine how technology has affected strategy and tactics, intelligence, logistics, communications and command. With laudable clarity, he explains the application of nuclear energy and computer technology to the military, as well as the latest developments in electronic warfare and their possible deployment on future battlefields. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Dangerous Book for Boys</h2><p>Lovely red linen boards with gold and black lettering.

It is an authoritative resource, an exhaustive catalog of supernatural beings whose names appear in the Bible (that is, the Hebrew Bible, the Septuagint, and the New Testament). However, some readers who turn to this work based on its title are in for a few surprises. Along with the anticipated articles on angels, Baal, cherubim, Dagon, Elohim, and Yahweh, they will also find ones on Esau, Jacob, Leah, Rachel, Moses, and Mary. Given the criteria established by the editorscandidates are those whose name contains that of a deity (Hebrew or otherwise) and humans who later achieved divine statustheir inclusion makes sense. Despite the inclusiveness of their criteria, the editors admit the inclusion of [some] deities often is more a tribute to scholarly ingenuity than an accurate picture of the religious situation in biblical times. The articles are full of transliterated ancient words, linguistic terminology, and parenthetical references that may make wading through them an investment not worth the return for general readers.

In his more than sixty years in the courtroom, Spence has never represented a person charged with a crime in which the police hadn't themselves violated the law. Whether by hiding, tampering with, or manufacturing evidence; by gratuitous violence and even murder, those who are charged with upholding the law too often break it. Spence points to the explosion of brutality leading up to the murder of Freddie Gray in Baltimore, insisting that this is the way it has always been: cops get away with murder. <i>Nothing changes. </i></p><p><i>Police State </i>narrates the shocking account of the Madrid train bombings - how the FBI accused an innocent man of treasonous acts they knew he hadn't committed. It details the rampant racism within Chicago's police department, which landed teenager Dennis Williams on death row. It unveils the deliberately coercive efforts of two cops to extract a false murder confession from frightened and mentally fragile Albert Hancock, along with other appalling evidence from eight of Spence's most famous cases.</p><p>We all want to feel safe. But how can we be safe when the very police we pay to protect us instead kill us, maim us, and falsify the evidence against us? Can we accept the argument that cops may occasionally overstep their boundaries, but only when handling guilty criminals and never with us? Can we expect them to investigate and prosecute themselves when faced with allegations of misconduct? Can we believe that they are acting for our own good? Too many innocent are convicted; too many are wrongly executed. The cost has become too high for a free people to bear.</p><p>In <i>Police State</i>, Spence issues a stinging indictment of the American justice system. Demonstrating that the way we select and train our police guarantees fatal abuses of justice, he also prescribes a challenging cure that stands to restore America's promise of liberty and justice for all.</p></p><p>Gerry Spence is a legendary trial lawyer who has been practicing law since 1952 and has never lost a criminal case. Spence is known for going after systems of power that victimize innocent Americans. He remains famous for his defense of Karen Silkwood, Randy Weaver, and Imelda Marcos, among many others. He lives in Wyoming - where he founded the Trial Lawyers College - with his wife, Imaging. <i>Police State</i> is his seventeenth book.<p>&#x201c;We at Southern Poverty Law Center always knew the truth about which Spence writes. Too often the poor and middle class are brutalized and killed by the police in this 'land of the free,' and Spence offers solutions America must listen to.&#x201d; &#x2015;Morris Dees, President, Southern Poverty Law Center</p><p>&#x201c;In his celebrated career Gerry Spence has not met a criminal that he didn't like or who was not the victim of police or judicial malfeasance. This book revisits his most celebrated cases, some of which represented law enforcement at its worst. It is written with passion, some literary license, and from the fascinating perspective of his interviews with his clients. While I disagree that we are marching towards a police state, Mr. Spence reminds us that no system is perfect. It demands vigilance and people like him to test it.&#x201d; &#x2015;Judge Judy</p><p>&#x201c;A riveting account from the front lines of Gerry Spence's lifelong battle against injustice.

So, too, says Spence. Spence both exposes the old and proposes the new in ways that may well surprise and satisfy.&#x201d; &#x2015;Harrison Ford</p><p>&#x201c;Gerry Spence's shocking experiences with rogue, killer police in his own cases prove his point, and he offers insightful new solutions that could assure a better tomorrow in the tragic struggle between law enforcement and the people they are sworn to protect.&#x201d; &#x2015;Alan K. Simpson, U.S. Senator, Wyoming (1979-1997)</p><p>&#x201c;Those of us who have been in the hard world of defending against police who kill, lie, and cover it up know what Spence says is true. And his solutions are original and thought-provoking,&#x201d; &#x2015;Milton Grimes, Attorney to Rodney King</p><p>"Gerry Spence has written a terrific book on the problems with today's criminal justice system. <i>Police State: How America's Cops Get Away with Murder</i> gives us the best of Gerry Spence. Spence starts out by asking the basic question: "Are we safe from our own police?" What he really wants to ask, however, comes a bit later: "Are we safe from power?" Using tales of his brilliance in court, Spence answers those questions. No, we are not safe, and that is precisely why we need people like Gerry Spence to represent people in court."-- Laurie L.

Before long, Walker finds himself caught in a perverse triangle that leads to a sudden, shocking act of violence that will alter the course of his life.</p><p>Three different narrators tell the story of Invisible, a novel that travels in time from 1967 to 2007 and moves from Morningside Heights, to the Left Bank of Paris, to a remote island in the Caribbean. It is a book of youthful rage, unbridled sexual hunger, and a relentless quest for justice. With uncompromising insight, Auster takes us into the shadowy borderland between truth and memory, between authorship and identity, to produce a work of unforgettable power that confirms his reputation as &#x201c;one of America&#x2019;s most spectacularly inventive writers.&#x201d;&nbsp; </p></p><p>Paul Auster is the bestselling author of <i>Sunset Park, Man in the Dark, Travels in the Scriptorium, The Brooklyn Follies</i>, and <i>Oracle Night</i>. <i>I Thought My Father Was God</i>, the NPR National Story Project anthology, which he edited, was also a national bestseller. In 2006, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters for Literature. His work has been translated into thirty-five languages. He lives in Brooklyn, New York.&nbsp;INVISIBLE, Paul Auster&#39;s fifteenth novel, features eclectic Frenchman Rudolf Born and his silent, alluring girlfriend, Margot. Together, Born and Margot ensnare young Adam Walker in a shocking and intriguing tale of sex and violence. The highly imaginative story runs from 1967 to 2007, taking the reader from Morningside Heights to Paris and to the Caribbean. Auster also narrates, with a performance that demonstrates the benefits and dangers of an author at the microphone. Because the story is told by three narrators, it would have benefited from a more versatile reader, or three separate readers. While Auster&#39;s reading is precise, at times it seems understated, and almost distracted. As a result, rather than focusing on Auster&#39;s dialogue and plot, the listener hungers for greater intensity and emotion. In sum, INVISIBLE is highly entertaining but a bit uneven.

The son of a Yale-educated investment banker, he grew up in a huge apartment on Sutton Place, high above the East River, and attended a tony Manhattan private school. Yet, more than anything, he wants to get out&#x2013;out from under his parents&#x2019; influence, off to Graymont College, in western Massachusetts, where he hopes to become a writer.<br><br>When he arrives, in the fall of 1986, Julian meets Carter Heinz, a scholarship student from California with whom he develops a strong but ambivalent friendship. Carter&#x2019;s mother, desperate to save money for his college education, used to buy him reversible clothing, figuring she was getting two items for the price of one. Now, spending time with Julian, Carter seethes with resentment.

Out!&#x201d; The first words Julian Wainwright ever spoke, according to his father, Richard Wainwright III, graduate of Yale and grand lubricator of the economic machinery, and Julian&#x2019;s mother, Constance Wainwright, Wellesley graduate and descendant of a long family of Pennsylvania Republicans. Julian, the first Wainwright in four generations to be given his own Christian name. Julian&#x2019;s father would have liked another Richard Wainwright, but Julian&#x2019;s mother was a persistent woman and she believed a child of hers was entitled to his own identity and therefore his own name. And so, at fifteen months, in a car ride back from Martha&#x2019;s Vineyard, Julian, who until then had not said a word and had given his parents every reason to think language would come slowly to him, uttered these words in rapid succession: &#x201c;Out! Out! Out!&#x201d; Not once, not twice, but repeatedly, until the words became a chant and it was obvious that for reasons all his own he didn&#x2019;t want to return to New York City, to his parents&#x2019; apartment on Sutton Place.<br><br>Now, seventeen years later, he had gotten his wish. It was 1986, and he was starting his freshman year at Graymont College, a small liberal arts school in Northington, Massachusetts, two hours west of Boston. An alternative school, according to the Graymont brochure, on whose cover there appeared a picture of Rousseau sitting next to a cow. Henri Rousseau? Jean-Jacques Rousseau? The students didn&#x2019;t know, and they didn&#x2019;t seem to care. The only thing that mattered was that they were at Graymont, in the middle of whose campus stood a shanty protesting college investments in South Africa, a shanty so large it could fit practically the whole student body inside it. According to one upper-class math major, more nights per capita had been spent sleeping inside the shanty at Graymont than in any other college shanty in the United States.<br><br>At Graymont, if you wanted, you could receive comments from your professors instead of grades, and on the application for admission there was a &#x201c;creative expression&#x201d; section that, according to rumor, one successful applicant had completed by baking a chocolate cake. &#x201c;Hash brownies!&#x201d; a student said. &#x201c;The guy got the dean of admissions stoned!&#x201d;<br><br>Julian&#x2019;s own creative expression section took the form of a short story he&#x2019;d written. At thirteen, he&#x2019;d met his hero, John Cheever, standing on the steps of the 92nd Street Y, and ever since then, ever since he&#x2019;d gotten John Cheever&#x2019;s autograph, Julian had known he was going to be a writer.<br><br>But that would come later, once classes had begun. Right now, Julian waited in his dorm room to greet his new roommate, a young man from New Jersey who had assured him over the telephone that he was bringing the largest stereo system Julian had ever seen. It was going to take the two of them to carry it up the stairs.<br><br>Julian&#x2019;s roommate was right. The promised stereo system, when it was delivered, looked like an intercontinental ballistic missile. It was a stereo system paid for by Ronald Reagan and built by the United States Pentagon and directed at Mikhail Gorbachev and the Soviet Politburo, a stereo system that could blow the Russians out of the sky and turn them into a mushroom cloud.<br><br>Wandering about the room, trailing wire behind him, Julian&#x2019;s roommate was contemplating where to put his electric guitar, his boom box, his microwave, his toaster oven; he was, Julian thought, a tangle of electricity. &#x201c;This school is wild,&#x201d; his roommate said. &#x201c;Some of the guys on campus wear skirts.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They do?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re hoping to transcend the boundaries of gender. Mostly they&#x2019;re just trying to get laid. There are naked parties here. People come to them without any clothes on.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Completely nude?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In the winter, I guess, they wear shoes and socks. It gets pretty cold here.&#x201d; Julian&#x2019;s roommate was dark-haired and thickset, and he had brought with him piles of pressed shirts and trousers, each of them separated from the others by a white piece of tissue paper, as if they had come directly from the dry cleaner. He was hanging them up now, smoothing them out with his hand. &#x201c;You think those guys pee in the shower?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Which guys?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jared and Hartley. Bill. Stefan.&#x201d; Julian&#x2019;s roommate gestured to the room down the hall. &#x201c;Hartley&#x2019;s the kind of guy who pees in the shower.&#x201d;<br><br>In the bathroom now, Julian glanced warily at the showers. There were two stalls for six guys, each with a white piece of plastic hanging down from the rod but not quite reaching the floor.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s bad enough to pee in your own shower,&#x201d; his roommate said. &#x201c;But in a communal shower?&#x201d; He looked up at Julian. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t pee in the shower, do you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Julian said. From time to time he had. Didn&#x2019;t everyone?<br><br>&#x201c;I had this roommate in prep school who peed in the sink.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Julian said.<br><br>&#x201c;Swear to God. When I was using the bathroom and he needed to go, he&#x2019;d just climb up on the sink and pee in it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s disgusting.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All the same, I think I&#x2019;ll be wearing flip-flops in here.&#x201d; Again his roommate gestured to the room down the hall, as if to reassure Julian it wasn&#x2019;t him he mistrusted.<br><br>&#x201c;Here come the PCC-ers,&#x201d; his roommate said. Through the window, Julian could see a group of students walking across the quad. They wore blue badges and name tags and held red and black satchels. They were upperclassmen, Julian&#x2019;s roommate said, recent graduates of a weeklong training course in reproductive health, purveyors of information about pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease, and in their satchels they carried the tools of their trade: leaflets, condoms, dental dams, and spermicide in all flavors. <br><br>Julian said, &#x201c;The PCC-ers?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Peer Contraceptive Counseling. First night at school, they come talk to you. It&#x2019;s all part of in loco parentis.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There are dozens of them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Like flies,&#x201d; his roommate said.<br>That night, as his roommate had predicted, everyone in Julian&#x2019;s entryway met with four members of Peer Contraceptive Counseling, each wearing a PCC badge and name tag and holding a red and black PCC satchel. In freshman entryways across campus, upperclassmen had descended, wearing these very same badges and name tags and carrying these very same satchels.<br><br>Julian listened to a beautiful young woman named Nicole demonstrate how to use a dental dam. What exactly was a dental dam and why was Nicole wearing one? She appeared to be covered in Saran Wrap. Now Nicole&#x2019;s colleagues, Brian, Ted, and Simone, were trying on dental dams as well. Several of the boys began to laugh, but the girls nodded knowingly, as if they&#x2019;d spent their whole lives in the company of dental dams.<br><br>Soon it was time to taste the spermicide.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing to be afraid of,&#x201d; Nicole said, uncapping a tube of spermicide and squeezing a little onto her finger. She stuck her finger into her mouth, then passed the spermicide to Ted, who stuck his finger into his mouth. Everyone was eating spermicide.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s fruit flavor,&#x201d; Nicole told the freshmen. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s supposed to be eaten.&#x201d;<br><br>She asked for volunteers from the students, and when no one raised a hand she chose Julian.<br><br>Julian stood up. Was he supposed to stand up? Did you eat spermicide sitting down or standing up? Nicole was only a junior, but she seemed so much older than he was, so wise to the ways of the body and to the various flavors of spermicide and to the reasons there should be various flavors of spermicide.<br><br>&#x201c;Would you like passion fruit?&#x201d; Nicole asked. &#x201c;Or strawberry?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Strawberry&#x2019;s good,&#x201d; Julian said.<br><br>Nicole handed him the spermicide.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; Nicole said. &#x201c;It goes down smooth. It tastes like strawberry bubble gum.&#x201d;<br><br>Julian squeezed some spermicide onto his finger and stuck it into his mouth.<br><br>&#x201c;How does it taste?&#x201d;<br><br>It tasted terrible. Like strawberry bubblegum but with extra chemicals. It had a sloppy, grainy texture. Julian nodded in approval.<br><br>The session lasted an hour and a half, and at the end of it all eighteen freshmen from Julian&#x2019;s entryway were sent off with a contraceptive loot bag that included spermicide, dental dams, and condoms, miniature red and black satchels of their own taken from the larger satchels the PCC-ers carried with them. Carefully, seriously, respectfully, the girls took their satchels upstairs to their rooms, while the boys tossed the contents at one another and dissected them, and Hartley, from across the hall, filled his condoms with water and jettisoned them out the window into the courtyard, seeing if he could get them to explode.<br><br>Julian&#x2019;s roommate said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m telling you, that guy pees in the shower.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Could be,&#x201d; Julian said. He went into his bedroom to unpack.<br>The reason Julian had come to Graymont, the only reason, as far as he was concerned, that anyone should come in the first place, was to study fiction writing with Professor Stephen Chesterfield. In the course catalogue the class was called &#x201c;Fiction Writing Workshop,&#x201d; but Professor Chesterfield hated the word &#x201c;workshop,&#x201d; which sounded like a church meeting, hated it, especially, as a verb (&#x201c;Will my story be workshopped next time, Professor Chesterfield?&#x201d;), the use of which was grounds for expulsion from his class.<br><br>If you were lucky enoug...</p><h2>Calling All Creeps!

Drawing on period letters and chronicles, and on the papers of the Virginia Company&#x2013;which financed the settlement of Jamestown&#x2013;David Price tells a tale of cowardice and courage, stupidity and brilliance, tragedy and costly triumph. He takes us into the day-to-day existence of the English men and women whose charge was to find gold and a route to the Orient, and who found, instead, hardship and wretched misery. Death, in fact, became the settlers&#x2019; most faithful companion, and their infighting was ceaseless.<br><br>Price offers a rare balanced view of the relationship between the settlers and the natives. He unravels the crucial role of Pocahontas, a young woman whose reality has been obscured by centuries of legend and misinformation (and, more recently, animation). He paints indelible portraits of Chief Powhatan, the aged monarch who came close to ending the colony&#x2019;s existence, and Captain John Smith, the former mercenary and slave, whose disdain for class distinctions infuriated many around him&#x2013;even as his resourcefulness made him essential to the colony&#x2019;s success.<br><br><i>Love and Hate in Jamestown </i>is a superb work of popular history, reminding us of the horrors and heroism that marked the dawning of our nation.</p><p>"A fine book...one that personifies the virtues I esteem...clarity, intelligence, grace,<br>novelty, and brevity." <br> --David L.

Gordianus has just turned eighteen and is about to embark on the adventure of a lifetime: a far-flung journey to see the Seven Wonders of the World. Gordianus is not yet called &#x201c;the Finder&#x201d;&#x2014;but at each of the Seven Wonders, the wide-eyed young Roman encounters a mystery to challenge the powers of deduction.<br>Accompanying Gordianus on his travels is his tutor, Antipater of Sidon, the world&#x2019;s most celebrated poet. But there is more to the apparently harmless old poet than meets the eye. Before they leave home, Antipater fakes his own death and travels under&nbsp;an assumed identity. Looming in the background are the first rumblings of a political upheaval that will shake the entire Roman world.<br>Teacher and pupil journey to the fabled cities of Greece and Asia Minor, and then to Babylon and Egypt. They attend the Olympic Games, take part in exotic festivals, and marvel at the most spectacular constructions ever devised by mankind. Along the way they encounter murder, witchcraft and ghostly hauntings. Traveling the world for the first time, Gordianus discovers that amorous exploration goes hand-in-hand with crime-solving. The mysteries of love are the true wonders of the world, and at the end of the journey, an Eighth Wonder awaits him in Alexandria. Her name is Bethesda.</p><p><p>STEVEN SAYLOR is the author of acclaimed historical mystery novels featuring Gordianus the Finder, including The Triumph of Caesar, as well as the internationally bestselling historical novels Empire and Roma.&nbsp; He has appeared on the History Channel as an expert on Roman politics and life.&nbsp; He divides his time between Berkeley, California and Austin, Texas.</p><b>I</b><br><b><i>Prelude in Rome:</i></b><br><b>THE DEAD MAN WHO WASN&#x2019;T</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Now that you&#x2019;re dead, Antipater, what do you plan to do with yourself?&#x201d;<br>My father laughed at his own joke. He knew perfectly well what Antipater was planning to do, but he couldn&#x2019;t resist a paradoxical turn of phrase. Puzzles were my father&#x2019;s passion&#x2014;and solving them his profession. He called himself Finder, because men hired him to find the truth.<br>Not surprisingly, old Antipater answered with a poem made up on the spot; for yes, the Antipater of whom I speak was <i>the</i> Antipater of Sidon&#x2014;one of the most celebrated poets in the world, famed not only for the elegance of his verses but for the almost magical way he could produce them impromptu, as if drawn from the aether. His poem was in Greek, of course:<br><i>&#x201c;I died on my birthday, so I must leave Rome.</i><br><i>Now your son has his birthday&#x2014;is it time to leave home?&#x201d;</i><br>Antipater&#x2019;s question, like my father&#x2019;s, was merely rhetorical. For days the old poet and I had been making preparations to leave Rome together on this day. He gave me a smile. &#x201c;It does seem unfair, my boy, that your birthday should be overshadowed by my funeral.&#x201d;<br>I resisted the urge to correct him. Despite his lingering habit of addressing me as a boy, I was in fact a man, and had been so for exactly a year, since I put on my manly toga when I turned seventeen. &#x201c;What better way to celebrate my birthday, Teacher, than to set out on a journey such as most people can only dream of?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well put!&#x201d; Antipater squeezed my shoulder. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not every young man who can look forward to seeing with his own eyes the greatest monuments ever built by mankind, and in the company of mankind&#x2019;s greatest poet.&#x201d; Antipater had never been modest. Now that he was dead, I suppose he had no reason to be.<br>&#x201c;And it&#x2019;s not every man who has the privilege of gazing upon his own funeral stele,&#x201d; my father said, indicating with a wave of his hand the object of which he spoke.<br>The three of us stood in the garden of my father&#x2019;s house on the Esquiline Hill. The sky was cloudless and the air was warm for the month of Martius. In front of us&#x2014;delivered only moments before from the sculptor&#x2019;s workshop&#x2014;stood a riddle in marble. It was a funeral stele for a man who was not dead. The rectangular tablet was elegantly carved and brightly painted, and only about a foot tall. Later it would be placed atop the sepulcher intended for the dead man&#x2019;s ashes, but for now it was propped atop the crate in which it had been delivered.<br>Antipater nodded thoughtfully. &#x201c;And not every man has the opportunity to design his own monument, as I have. You don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s <i>too</i> irreverent, do you, Finder? I mean, we don&#x2019;t want anyone to look at this stele and realize it&#x2019;s a hoax. If anyone should surmise that I&#x2019;ve faked my own death&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Stop worrying, old friend. Everything is going as we planned. Five days ago I entered your death in the register at the Temple of Libitina. Thanks to the rich matrons who send a slave to check the lists several times a day, word of your demise spread across Rome in a matter of hours. People assumed that your old friend and patron Quintus Lutatius Catulus must be in possession of your remains and in charge of the funeral arrangements. There was disbelief when it was discovered that a citizen as humble as myself had been named executor in your will, and that your remains were to be displayed in the vestibule of my house. But so it was. I summoned the undertakers to wash and perfume the body, purchased flowers, cypress sprigs, incense, and a very elegant bier&#x2014;your will provided for all necessary expenses&#x2014;and then I put your corpse on display in the vestibule. And what a turnout you&#x2019;ve received! All the poets and half the politicians in Rome have come to pay their respects.&#x201d;<br>Antipater flashed a wry smile. &#x201c;My demise has allowed you to make the acquaintance of the best people in Rome, Finder&#x2014;just the sort who are always getting dragged into court for murdering each other. I daresay this could prove a windfall for you&#x2014;meeting so many potential new clients!&#x201d;<br>My father nodded. &#x201c;Everyone has come to have a look, it seems&#x2014;except Catulus. Do you imagine your patron is sulking, because the will didn&#x2019;t name him as executor?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;More likely he&#x2019;s been holding off, waiting until today to pay his respects&#x2014;the day of the funeral&#x2014;so that his visit will be as conspicuous as possible. Catulus may have the soul of a poet, but he has the instincts of a politician&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>Antipater fell silent at the sound of a knock at the front door.<br>&#x201c;Another caller. I shall disappear at once.&#x201d; Antipater hurried to the concealed door that gave access to a narrow chamber next to the vestibule, where a tiny crack in the wall served as a peephole and allowed him to observe all that transpired.<br>A moment later, my father&#x2019;s doorkeeper&#x2014;the only slave he owned at that time&#x2014;appeared in the garden.<br>&#x201c;You have a visitor, Master,&#x201d; Damon wheezed. The constant flood of callers was running the poor old fellow ragged. He cleared his throat and I saw him concentrate, determined to get the name right. &#x201c;Lintus Quitatius Catulus, former consul of the Republic, has come to pay his respects to the deceased.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Quintus Lutatius Catulus, I think you mean,&#x201d; said my father indulgently. &#x201c;Come, son, let us greet the consul.&#x201d;<br>The man in the vestibule was perhaps sixty years old. Like my father and me, he was dressed in a black toga, but his was embroidered with a purple band that marked his status as a senator. Ten years ago Catulus had served as consul and commander of the legions; it was his army that annihilated the Cimbri at the battle of the Raudine Plain. But Catulus was also a man of culture and learning, and was said to have a sensitive nature. He stood stiffly upright before the funeral bier with his hands crossed before him.<br>My father introduced himself, and me as well, but Catulus hardly seemed to notice. &#x201c;Your distinguished presence graces my home, Consul, though I regret the sadness of the occasion. Did you come alone?&#x201d;<br>Catulus raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;Of course not. I left my retinue outside, so that I could spend a moment alone with my old friend&#x2014;face-to-face, so to speak. But alas, his face is covered.&#x201d; Catulus gestured to the mask, made of wax, which concealed the face of the corpse. &#x201c;Is it true that his features were damaged by the fall?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid so,&#x201d; said my father. &#x201c;The undertakers did what they could to make him presentable, but the damage was such that I decided it was preferable to conceal the injuries. Normally, a death mask is made from the direct impression of the face in repose. But in this case, I hired a sculptor to create the likeness. The mask will be used in the funeral procession, as usual, but until then I&#x2019;ve placed it over his face. I think the sculptor did a very good job, don&#x2019;t you? It really does look like Antipater, lying there with his eyes shut, as if he slept. Still, if you wish to gaze upon his face....&#x201d;<br>Catulus nodded grimly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a military man, Finder. I&#x2019;ve seen the most terrible things that can be done to human flesh. Show me.&#x201d;<br>My father stepped to the bier and lifted the death mask.<br>The staid consul&#x2019;s abrupt, girlish shriek, stifled by a fist to his mouth, was so incongruous that I almost laughed out loud. Behind the wall, I heard a noise like loose plaster falling, and imagined Antipater shaking with mirth.<br>Catulus glanced at the wall. My father shrugged and looked embarrassed, as if to apologize for the presence of rats.<br>&#x201c;But how could a mere fall have resulted in such terrible disfigurement?&#x201d; Catulus kept his fist pressed to his mouth. He looked a bit green.<br>&#x201c;It was a long fall,&#x201d; explained my father, &#x201c;from the top floor of an apartment in the Subura, five stories up. He landed on his head. As I say, the undertakers did what they could&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, I understand. Replace the mask, please.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course, Consul.&#x201d;<br>Not for the first time, I wondered about the true identity of the corpse upon the bier. My father had declined to tell me, following his long-standing practice of keeping to himself any aspect of his work that he deemed unnecessary for me to know. When I turned seventeen, I had thought my father might see fit to share all his secrets with me, but if anything, he had become more guarded than ever during the last year. I knew that something very dangerous must be afoot in Rome, for Antipater to fake his own death, and for my father to assist him in such a wild scheme, but regarding the details, I had been kept in the dark.<br>The elderly body on the bier was apparently an excellent match for Antipater; not one of the many visitors had expressed the least doubt. Of course, the only parts of the corpse that were visible were the long white hair and beard and the wrinkled, age-spotted hands crossed over the chest, the rest being covered by one of Antipater&#x2019;s favorite garments and by the mask. The man truly had died from a fall in the Subura, just as my father described, cracking his skull and shattering his face. Had he been a slave, discreetly acquired from his owner? Or some lowlife criminal whom no one cared to claim? Or simply some ancient citizen of the Subura without family or friends to mourn him? Whoever he was, he had died at the right time and in such a manner that he could be passed off as Antipater. In a way, my father had done the poor fellow a favor; the dead man had been mourned by the best people in Rome and was about to receive funeral rites far above his station.<br>&amp;...</p><h2>The Speaker&#39;s Primer</h2><p>This book addresses the nuts and bolts of crafting and delivering different types of presentations, but unlike other public speaking handbooks, it builds on those principles and offers guidance on speaking in particular professional arenas.

A parish priest, he now divides his time between the church and writing picture books and fiction for children, including the widely acclaimed Wyvern Quartet.

He came to London in 1970 and studied illustration at the Royal College of Art. Juan Wijngaard received his first commission to illustrate a children's book while still at art school. Since then, he has illustrated more than thirty books and has won the Mother Goose Award and the Kate<br>Greenaway Medal.Grade 4-8&#x2013;Plays are meant to be seen, and this interactive book features a fold-out model of the Globe Theatre in its heyday, complete with stage, galleries, thatched roof, and spectators ready for a performance. Selected punch-out characters from 12 of Shakespeare's plays are included (and attached to a small cardboard handle to allow for easy manipulation), as are two removable scripts that include monologues and/or scenes in which the characters appear. The package also provides a booklet introducing the Wooden O and the state of the theatre in Elizabethan and Jacobean times as explained by Richard Burbage, leading actor of the King's Players. The well-constructed 10-inch model is made with a good-quality lightweight cardboard and is drawn to scale and filled with accurate architectural details. The excerpts from the plays are exact quotes. A brief plot summary introduces each scene; however, the language of the commentary (as if offered by Burbage) is elevated and the structure quite formal. The illustrated booklet provides interesting information, but for those with little or no background in this theatrical tradition, the explanations may be incomplete. While the book's fragile nature will make it difficult to circulate, libraries might consider purchasing it for classroom or program use.<i>&#x2013;Nancy Menaldi-Scanlan, LaSalle Academy, Providence, RI</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This book answers the call as it delivers the life and times of Marlys Mullen, the most beloved character in Barry&#39;s nationally syndicated comic strip, &#39;Ernie Pook&#39;s Comeek.&#39; Way back in the mid-1980s, Barry introduced the character of Marlys Mullen, her crazy groovy teenage sister Maybonne, her sensitive and strange little brother Freddie, a mother like no other, and an array of cousins and friends from the &#39;hood. This oversized book presents the long strange journey through puberty and life that Marlys and company have experienced. Marlys&#39;s universe and galaxy are funny, rude, disturbing, tearful . . . in short, very, very Lynda Barry.</p><p>Lynda Barry has worked as a painter, cartoonist, writer, illustrator, playwright, editor, commentator, and teacher. She is the inimitable creator behind the seminal comic strip &#34;Ernie Pook&#39;s Comeek&#34;, and author of &#34;The Freddie Stories&#34;, &#34;One! Hundred! Demons!&#34;, &#34;The! Greatest! of! Marlys!&#34;, &#34;Cruddy: An Illustrated Novel&#34;, &#34;Naked Ladies! Naked Ladies! Naked Ladies!&#34;, and &#34;The Good Times are Killing Me&#34;, which was adapted as an off-Broadway play and won the Washington State Governor&#39;s Award. Barry has written three bestselling and acclaimed creative how-to graphic novels for D+Q: the Eisner Award-winning &#34;What It Is&#34;, and &#34;Picture This&#34;, &#34; &#34;and &#34;Syllabus&#34; &#34;Notes from an accidental professor.&#34;Charmingly illustrated and written in the voices of fictional preadolescents, Barry's comics (The Freddie Stories) alternate between delightful comedy and un-self-conscious poetry. Her comics catalogue the incremental maturation of the smart but unpopular preteen Marlys; her painfully sensitive little brother, Freddie; her big sister, Maybonne; her cousins Arna and Arnold; and occasionally the various adults in their lives. The book collects more than 200 of her syndicated four-panel strip Ernie Pook's Comeek, in which Barry deftly maps the emotional terrain of Marlys and the inevitable social traumas inherent in growing up. Alternating among the voices of the family, Barry offers stories on difficult teachers (Mr. Valotto has sideburns, wears turtleneck dickeys and "thinks he's hip"); boys (Marlys goes broke "buying Twinkies to split with Kevin Turner"); Marlys's difficult mother ("five guys asked her to marry them before she picked my father, the worst mistake of her life") and much more. While Barry can be funny presenting the silly escapades and fantasies of Marlys, Arna, Freddie and Arnold, her real talent is the very nearly poetic invocation of moments of pubescent joy and humiliation as well as of the wonder at the fast-approaching, mysterious state of being a teenager. Her black-and-white drawings are crudely drawn, yet lyrical and emotionally complex.

Please, trust me. I most definitely can be cheerful. I can be amiable. Agreeable. Affable. And that's only the A's. Just don't ask me to be nice. Nice has nothing to do with me.<br>***Reaction to the&nbsp; ***<br>AFOREMENTIONED fact<br>Does this worry you?<br>I urge you--don't be afraid.<br>I'm nothing if not fair.<br>--Of course, an introduction.<br>A beginning.<br>Where are my manners?<br>I could introduce myself properly, but it's not really necessary. You will know me well enough and soon enough, depending on a diverse range of variables. It suffices to say that at some point in time, I will be standing over you, as genially as possible. Your soul will be in my arms. A color will be perched on my shoulder. I will carry you gently away.<br>At that moment, you will be lying there (I rarely find people standing up). You will be caked in your own body. There might be a discovery; a scream will dribble down the air. The only sound I'll hear after that will be my own breathing, and the sound of the smell, of my footsteps.<br>The question is, what color will everything be at that moment when I come for you? What will the sky be saying?<br>Personally, I like a chocolate-colored sky. Dark, dark chocolate. People say it suits me. I do, however, try to enjoy every color I see--the whole spectrum. A billion or so flavors, none of them quite the same, and a sky to slowly suck on. It takes the edge off the stress. It helps me relax.<br>***A SMALL THEORY&nbsp; ***<br>People observe the colors of a day only at its beginnings and ends, but to me it's quite clear that a day merges through a multitude of shades and intonations, with each passing moment. <br>A single hour can consist of thousands of different colors. <br>Waxy yellows, cloud-spat blues. Murky darknesses. <br>In my line of work, I make it a point to notice them.<br>As I've been alluding to, my one saving grace is distraction. It keeps me sane. It helps me cope, considering the length of time I've been performing this job. The trouble is, who could ever replace me? Who could step in while I take a break in your stock-standard resort-style vacation destination, whether it be tropical or of the ski trip variety? The answer, of course, is nobody, which has prompted me to make a conscious, deliberate decision--to make distraction my vacation. Needless to say, I vacation in increments. In colors.<br>Still, it's possible that you might be asking, why does he even need a vacation? What does he need distraction from?<br>Which brings me to my next point.<br>It's the leftover humans.<br>The survivors.<br>They're the ones I can't stand to look at, although on many occasions I still fail. I deliberately seek out the colors to keep my mind off them, but now and then, I witness the ones who are left behind, crumbling among the jigsaw puzzle of realization, despair, and surprise. They have punctured hearts. They have beaten lungs.<br>Which in turn brings me to the subject I am telling you about tonight, or today, or whatever the hour and color. It's the story of one of those perpetual survivors--an expert at being left behind.<br>It's just a small story really, about, among other things:<br>* A girl<br>* Some words<br>* An accordionist<br>* Some fanatical Germans<br>* A Jewish fist fighter<br>* And quite a lot of thievery<br>I saw the book thief three times.<br>BESIDE THE RAILWAY LINE<br>First up is something white. Of the blinding kind.<br>Some of you are most likely thinking that white is not really a color and all of that tired sort of nonsense. Well, I'm here to tell you that it is. White is without question a color, and personally, I don't think you want to argue with me.<br>***A REASSURING ANNOUNCEMENT&nbsp; ***<br>Please, be calm, despite that previous threat.<br>I am all bluster--<br>I am not violent. <br>I am not malicious.<br>I am a result.<br>Yes, it was white.<br>It felt as though the whole globe was dressed in snow. Like it had pulled it on, the way you pull on a sweater. Next to the train line, footprints were sunken to their shins. Trees wore blankets of ice.<br>As you might expect, someone had died.<br>They couldn't just leave him on the ground. For now, it wasn't such a problem, but very soon, the track ahead would be cleared and the train would need to move on.<br>There were two guards.<br>There was one mother and her daughter.<br>One corpse.<br>The mother, the girl, and the corpse remained stubborn and silent.<br>"Well, what else do you want me to do?"<br>The guards were tall and short. The tall one always spoke first, though he was not in charge. He looked at the smaller, rounder one. The one with the juicy red face.<br>"Well," was the response, "we can't just leave them like this, can we?"<br>The tall one was losing patience. "Why not?"<br>And the smaller one damn near exploded. He looked up at the tall one's chin and cried, "Spinnst du! Are you stupid?!" The abhorrence on his cheeks was growing thicker by the moment. His skin widened. "Come on," he said, traipsing over the snow. "We'll carry all three of them back on if we have to. We'll notify the next stop."<br>As for me, I had already made the most elementary of mistakes. I can't explain to you the severity of my self-disappointment. Originally, I'd done everything right:<br>I studied the blinding, white-snow sky who stood at the window of the moving train. I practically inhaled it, but still, I wavered. I buckled--I became interested. In the girl.

Experts estimate that as many as 500 terrorist cells exist in America today. ABC News journalist John Miller has been tracking this story since his coverage of the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993. He was the first American journalist to interview Osama Bin Laden, and he has a sophisticated knowledge of the structure and workings of extremist organizations. <em>The Cell</em> contains information gleaned from sources within the FBI, CIA, and the local law enforcement communities currently conducting the investigation into the September 11 attacks.</p><p><strong>John Miller</strong> is an Emmy Award-winning broadcast journalist, co-host of ABC's <em>20/20</em> with Barbara Walters, and one of the few Western reporters ever to have interviewed Osama bin Laden. He lives in New York City. This is his first book.<br><br> <strong>Michael Stone</strong> is a veteran journalist who has covered many of New York's most notorious stories, including John Gotti, Robert Chambers and the Central Park jogger assault, and is the author of <em>Gangbusters</em>. He lives in New York City.<br><br> <strong>Chris Mitchell</strong> is a senior editor at <em>The Week</em>. His previous collaboration, Jack Maple's <em>The Crime Fighter</em>, inspired the television drama <em>The District</em>.ABC Reporter John Miller is one of the few journalists who has interviewed Osama bin Laden, and one of the few who reported on terrorism long before bin Laden became a household word. Miller's knowledge of the Islamic terrorist movement is encyclopedic. In THE CELL, Miller, with reporters Michael Stone and Chris Mitchell, details the birth of bin Laden's movement, how it grew, and why bin Laden and his followers focus their hatred on America. Miller reads the book with the authoritative voice of a news reporter who knows the story and wants to learn more. While acknowledging that the 9/11 attack may have been unpreventable, the authors explain why bureaucratic and political shortcomings led to the FBI and CIA's failure to uncover the plot, and raise concern as to why so many warnings went unheeded.

In the 1970s, the Swedish Social Democrats used global warming to get political support for building a string of nuclear power stations. It was the second phase of their war on coal, which began with the acid rain scare and the first big UN environment conference in Stockholm in 1969.<br> <br>Acid rain swept all before it. America held out for as long as Ronald Reagan was in the White House, but capitulated under his successor. Like global warming, acid rain had the vocal support of the scientific establishment, but the consensus science collapsed just as Congress was passing acid rain cap-and-trade legislation. Rather than tell legislators and the nation the truth, the EPA attacked a lead scientist and suppressed the federal report showing that the scientific case for action on curbing power station emissions was baseless.<br> <br>Ostensibly neutral in the Cold War, Sweden had a secret military alliance with Washington. A hero of the international Left, Sweden&#x2019;s Olof Palme used environmentalism to maintain a precarious balance between East and West. Thus Stockholm was the conduit for the KGB-inspired nuclear winter scare. The bait was taken by Carl Sagan and leading scientists, who tried to undermine Ronald Reagan&#x2019;s nuclear strategy and acted as propaganda tools to end the Cold War on Moscow&#x2019;s terms.<br> <br>Nuclear energy was to have been the solution to global warming. It didn&#x2019;t turn out that way, most of all thanks to Germany. Instead America and the world are following Germany&#x2019;s lead in embracing wind and solar. German obsession with renewable energy originates deep within its culture. Few know today that the Nazis were the first political party to champion wind power, Hitler calling wind the energy of the future.<br> <br>Post-1945 West Germany appeared normal, but anti-nuclear protests in the 1970s led to the fusion of extreme Left and Right and the birth of the Greens in 1980. Their rise changed Germany, then Europe and now the world. Radical environmentalism became mainstream. It demands more than the rejection of the abundant hydrocarbon energy that fuels American greatness. It requires the suppression of dissent.<br></p><p>Rupert Darwall is a strategy consultant and policy analyst.

He walked out on Hollywood, walked out of a shattered marriage, defied the courts, and, broke and an outlaw, set sail with his four children in the schooner Wanderer-bound for the South Seas. His attempt to escape launches this autobiography. It is the candid, sometimes painfully revealing confession of a man who scrutinized his every self-defeat and self-betrayal in the unblinking light of conscience. It is also the triumph of a complex and contradictory man, a rebel and a seeker, undefeated by his failure to find himself in love, adventure, drink, or escape to the South Seas. --This text refers to the Paperback edition.</p><p></p><h2>Cook&#39;s Country 2015 Annual American Test Kitchen</h2><p>Cook&#39;s Country 2015</p><p></p><h2>Sales-Side Negotiation: Negotiation Strategies for Modern-day Sales People (From Great Moments in History)</h2><p>Sales-Side Negotiation - What does it take to be a successful negotiator?

The lectures are the culmination of a lifetime of practical and philosophical reflection. In the first and second lecture, Soros discusses his general theory of reflexivity and its application to financial markets, providing insight into the recent financial crisis. The third and fourth lectures examine the concept of open society, which has guided Soros' global philanthropy, as well as the potential for conflict between capitalism and open society. The closing lecture focuses on the way ahead, closely examining the increasingly important economic and political role that China will play in the future. "The Budapest Lectures" presents these five seminal talks into one volume, which offers a condensed and highly readable summary of Soros' world view.</p></p><p><p><b>George Soros</b> is chairman of Soros Fund Management and the founder of a global network of foundations dedicated to supporting open societies.

Much of the attraction comes from the geographical and historical uniqueness of the island. Equidistant from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, Minoan Crete is on the shifting conceptual border between East and West, and chronologically suspended between history and prehistory. In this culturally dynamic context, architecture provided more than physical shelter; it embodied meaning. Architecture was a medium through which Minoans constructed their notions of social, ethnic, and historical identity: the buildings tell us about how the Minoans saw themselves, and how they wanted to be seen by others.</p><p>Architecture of Minoan Crete is the first comprehensive study of the entire range of Minoan architecture&#x2014;including houses, palaces, tombs, and cities&#x2014;from 7000 BC to 1100 BC. John C. McEnroe synthesizes the vast literature on Minoan Crete, with particular emphasis on the important discoveries of the past twenty years, to provide an up-to-date account of Minoan architecture. His accessible writing style, skillful architectural drawings of houses and palaces, site maps, and color photographs make this book inviting for general readers and visitors to Crete, as well as scholars.</p></p><p>JOHN C. McENROE is the John and Anne Fischer Professor of Fine Arts at Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, and a member of the American School of Classical Studies in Athens. He has worked in Crete for many years as a field archaeologist and excavation architect. His recent publications include Critical Perspectives in Art History (co-edited with Deborah Pokinski) and Pseira V: The Architecture of Pseira.&#34;Architecture of Minoan Crete: Constructing Identity in the Aegean Bronze Age investigates the prehistoric and early historic architectural material record of the island of Crete from a perspective largely informed by reflexive archaeological theory... A highlight of the book is its visual aesthetic which emphasises for the reader that not only does McEnroe have a solid grasp of all the issues involved but he is also a highly skilled surveyor and draftsman... Architecture of Minoan Crete is a highly engaging and visually appealing volume that will make a handsome addition to any Aegeanist&#39;s library. The author&#39;s light narrative touch and his consideration of such a wide timeframe have culminated in a welcome general introduction to the subject.&#34; Frank Lynam, Archaeological Review from Cambridge</p><h2>Fresh Faith: What Happens When Real Faith Ignites God&#39;s People</h2><p>One thing moves God: faith. Not doctrinal savvy. Not willpower. Trust in God alone stirs him to move miraculously on our behalf. Time and again, Jim Cymbala, author of Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire, has seen the power of faith displayed in the lives of the ordinary people in his church -- and in his own life. He has seen drug addicts and prostitutes set free, marriages restored, and sinners transformed by the love of Jesus Christ. All through the kind of radical, living faith described in this book. Read about it -- and discover how fresh faith can change your life, too.</p><p>According to Jim Cymbala, Satan is the "master thief" of our day, robbing us of faith. In <i>Fresh Faith</i>, the inner-city pastor and author of the bestselling <i>Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire</i>, challenges despair with the sword of Christian belief. In the wake of Satan's crime wave, Cymbala sees an overriding despondency that leads people to drugs, violence, and suicide. Even among pastors, Cymbala sees a turning away of Christ as "the first love," and instead he finds church leaders who are "hollow shells" of their former zealous selves. The final two sections of his book are devoted to "Getting Past the Barricades" and "Following the Divine Channel," showing readers how belief and trust can restore even the most damaged souls.<p> While Cymbala isn't the first pastor to try to ignite a fresh fire of faith, he is one of the most qualified. When he took over the leadership of the Brooklyn Tabernacle, the congregation was on the verge of extinction with only 26 members. The church is now 6,000 strong and a nationally recognized example of what a community's faith can do. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>In an era laced with worry about the present and cynicism about the future, in a climate in which we've grown tired of hoping for miracles and wary of trumped-up claims that only disappoint, comes a confident reminder that God has not fallen asleep. He has not forgotten his people nor retreated into semi-retirement. On the contrary, he is ready to respond to real faith wherever he finds it. <p> Pastor Jim Cymbala insists that faith is more than mental assent to some core beliefs. Fresh faith is not a magic formula that operates by believing hard and long enough to get what you want from God. Neither does it involve obeying a set of rules and laws so that you can struggle your way to faith. Rather, authentic, biblical faith is simple, honest, and utterly dependent upon God, a faith capable of transforming your life, your church, and the nation itself. </p><p> Jim Cymbala calls us back to authentic, biblical faith, a fiery, passionate preoccupation with God that will restore what the enemy has stolen from us: our first love for Jesus, our zeal, our troubled children, our wounded marriages, our broken and divided churches. Born out of the heart and soul of The Brooklyn Tabernacle, the message of Fresh Faith is illustrated by true stories of men and women whose lives have been changed through the power of faith.</p></p><h2>Quest for Community</h2><p><p></p><p>One of the leading thinkers to emerge in the postwar conservative intellectual revival was the sociologist Robert Nisbet. His book <b><i>The Quest for Community</i></b>, published in 1953, stands as one of the most persuasive accounts of the dilemmas confronting modern society.</p><p>Nearly a half century before Robert Putnam documented the atomization of society in <i>Bowling Alone</i>, Nisbet argued that the rise of the powerful modern state had eroded the sources of community&#x2014;the family, the neighborhood, the church, the guild. Alienation and loneliness inevitably resulted. But as the traditional ties that bind fell away, the human impulse toward community led people to turn even more to the government itself, allowing statism&#x2014;even totalitarianism&#x2014;to flourish.</p><p>ISI Books is proud to present this new edition of Nisbet&#x2019;s magnum opus, featuring a brilliant introduction by <i>New York Times </i>columnist Ross Douthat and three critical essays. Published at a time when our communal life has only grown weaker and when many Americans display cultish enthusiasm for a charismatic president, this new edition of <b><i>The Quest for Community</i></b> shows that Nisbet&#x2019;s insights are as relevant today as ever.</p><p></p></p><p><p></p><p><b>Robert Nisbet</b> (1913&#x2013;1996) was a professor at Columbia University and the author of <i>The Sociological Tradition</i>, <i>The Social Bond</i>, <i>The Present Age</i>, and other books.</p><p></p></p><h2>Not God&#39;s Type</h2><p><p></p><p>This is the story of a glorious defeat.</p><p>Ordway, an atheist academic, was convinced that faith was superstitious nonsense. As a well-educated college English professor, she saw no need for just-so stories about God. Secure in her fortress of atheism, she was safe (or so she thought) from any assault by irrational faith.</p><p>But then something happened . . . How did she come to &#x201c;lay down her arms&#x201d; in surrender to Christ &#x2013; and then, a few years later, enter into the Catholic Church?</p><p>This is the moving account of her unusual journey. It is the story of an academic becoming convinced of the truth of Christianity on rational grounds &#x2013; but also the account of God&#x2019;s grace acting in and through her imagination.</p><p> It is the tale of an unfolding, developing relationship with God, told with directness and honesty &#x2013; and of a painful surrender at the foot of the Cross. It is the account of a lifelong, transformative love of reading &#x2013; and the story of how a competitive fencer put down her sabre to pick up the sword of the Spirit.</p><p>Above all, this book is a tale of grace, acting in and through human beings but always issuing from God and leading back to Him. And it is the story of a woman being brought home.</p><p></p></p><p><b>Dr. Holly Ordway</b> is the chair of the Department of Apologetics at Houston Baptist University. She holds a Ph.D. in English literature from the University of Massachusetts Amherst; her academic work focuses on imagination and literature in apologetics, with special attention to the work of CS Lewis and Charles Williams."Moving from unbelief, to Evangelicalism, and finally home to the Catholic Church, Professor Holly Ordway reveals how a gifted mind, longing for transcendence, can only appropriate it if it is wholly given by the reach and power of God's grace." --<strong>Francis J. Beckwith</strong>, Professor of Philosophy and Church-State Studies, Baylor University<br><br>"Holly Ordway manages to dig into meaty intellectual topics without losing the personal, relatable elements of her story. The result is a book that has the rare combination of being both deeply intellectual and deeply human." --<strong>Jennifer Fulwiler</strong>, Author, <em>Something Other Than God</em><br><br>"Holly is living proof that C.S. Lewis was right when he said that a good atheist can't be too careful of her reading. A lover of the word, she discovered through it the love of the Logos, whose beauty fills all of creation. She found the courage to follow the spilled drops of human imagination back to the One who &#x2018;reflects the glory of God and bears the very stamp of his nature, upholding the universe by his word of power' (Heb 1:3)." --<strong>Mark P.

Rhea</i><br> Star cluster NGC 6281 </p><p> <i>Stardate 57717</i> </p><p> "Are we <i>there</i> yet?" </p><p> Lieutenant Commander Dawn Blair rolled her eyes at the question. "Are you going to ask that question every morning, Trys?" </p><p> "At least until we get there," T'Ryssa Chen replied, brushing her shaggy bangs out of her eyes. The gesture briefly revealed one of the elegantly pointed ears that she usually kept hidden under her shoulder-length black hair. </p><p> "You're just hoping to annoy me into letting you go on the away team," Blair said. </p><p> "Is it working?" </p><p> "Mmm...no." </p><p> "Aw, come on, Dawn!" T'Ryssa moaned. "A whole cluster full of carbon planets, and you expect me to sit up here manning a boring old console?" </p><p> "Well, it might help if you remembered to call me 'Commander' when we're on duty, <i>Lieutenant</i>." </p><p> T'Ryssa's slanted eyebrows twisted in a way that Blair still sometimes found incongruous. She knew the younger woman had been raised by her human mother and had barely known her Vulcan father, but it was hard to shake off one's expectations of Vulcans. Which was probably why T'Ryssa defied those expectations so aggressively. "Right, I keep forgetting." </p><p> "On purpose. You always have to be such a nonconformist, Trys. That's why you're still a jg at twenty-six." </p><p> "I don't <i>have</i> to be," T'Ryssa countered. "I'm just very good at it. Gotta play to your strengths, you know." </p><p> She grew serious, or as close as she ever came. "And I'm not very good at sitting still in a cubbyhole, which is why you've gotta let me go down there and do some science! When we get there," she added. "Come on, Daw -- Commander Dawn, sir, ma'am -- " At the science officer's glare, she started over. "I mean, this is a <i>Luna</i>-class ship, right? All about crew diversity and cross-cultural synergies and exploring new approaches? Which means, in short, we're a ship full of nonconformists, and proud of it. Nonconforming -- ity -- ism -- is how we get the job done around here, right?" T'Ryssa bent her knees and clasped her hands in supplication. "So how about it, O Dawn, commander of my heart? Pleeeeeze?" She actually batted her eyelids. </p><p> Blair sighed, knowing T'Ryssa would keep this up until she relented. "Okay! Okay. Janyl can man the console, you can go on the away team and out of my hair." </p><p> "Oh, thank you, thank you! And such lovely hair it is, my commandress." </p><p> "Don't push it," Blair said. She was self-conscious about her hair, an unruly mass of cinnamon-brown waves that she usually kept confined within a bun or French braid while on duty, though Derek from environmental engineering insisted it was the most gorgeous thing he'd ever seen. Still, she couldn't help smirking at T'Ryssa's antics. Blair was too soft a touch to be any good at keeping her in line, which was probably to T'Ryssa's detriment in the long run. But giving her this away mission could help improve her career prospects. The half-Vulcan woman may not have been very good at practicing Starfleet discipline or respecting the chain of command, but she was a good scientist with a knack for understanding alien behaviors, sentient and otherwise. If the anomalous biosigns coming from the carbon planets of the NGC 6281 star cluster were correct and there was complex life there, she could be genuinely useful. </p><p> "Anyway," Blair went on, "we have to get there first." </p><p> T'Ryssa sagged. "I am so sick of this. We hit a zone of altered subspace, we get knocked out of warp, we spend five hours recalibrating the warp engines, we make it four hours before the structure of subspace changes, and we drop out of warp again. I swear I'm getting motion sick. Are we getting any closer to figuring out a pattern behind these distortions?" </p><p> Blair shook her head. "Only that they seem connected to the energy emissions from the carbon planets. And that those emissions seem to be coming from beneath the planets' surfaces, not localized around any of the biosigns." </p><p> "What about the cosmozoans?" </p><p> "We can't confirm that the energy readings from them are connected. It could be interference from the subspace distortions." </p><p> T'Ryssa sighed, and Blair shared in her disappointment. As their sister ship <i>Titan</i> had confirmed half a year back, spacegoing life-forms were prone to inhabit star-formation regions. The open clusters <i>Rhea</i> was currently surveying were located be-tween the Orion and Carina Arms, removed from the star-formation zones that defined the arms of the galaxy, but they were still fairly young (as all open clusters were, for eventually their components were scattered by gravitational interactions with other stars and nebulae). NGC 6281 itself, a clump of a hundred or so young stars sharing a volume of space barely fifteen light-years in diameter, was less than a quarter billion years old and still retained a faint remnant of the nebula from which it had formed, so finding spacegoing organisms here was not a complete surprise. But the cosmozoans detected in this particular cluster were as strange as the space they occupied, giving off anomalous energy readings and biosignatures and seeming to appear and disappear unpredictably from sensors. Getting close to any of them, however, would take considerable time unless Blair and chief engineer Lorlinna could devise some way to adjust the warp engines to cope with the inexplicably shifting subspace geometry of this cluster. If they were unable to do so, then Captain Bazel might decide to turn back after the survey of the nearest component of the cluster, NGC 6281-34, and move on to the next open cluster once the <i>Rhea</i> slogged its way back to normal space. </p><p> It all depended on what they found on System 34's planets and whether it was exciting or mysterious enough to warrant surveying any of the other systems in the cluster. But it would be at least another day before they reached that system, a system they could reach in a few hours under normal circumstances. </p><p> Dawn Blair found herself agreeing with her friend's sentiment, if only in the privacy of her thoughts. <i>Are we</i> there <i>yet</i>? </p><p> T'Ryssa Chen hated going through the transporter. It wasn't that she was afraid of it or anything; rather, she was ticklish, and being transported felt like being tickled from the inside. People kept telling her she was imagining things, that there was no untoward sensation involved with transporting other than a slight tingling numbness, but she knew what she felt. Maybe it was a side effect of her hybrid nervous system; maybe all human-Vulcan blends had the same reaction but were too disciplined to admit it. Or maybe the transporter gods had just decided to pick on her. She tried to shake it off once she materialized, a convulsive move like she was trying to brush spiders off her body, but the heavy EV suit she wore hampered the movement. </p><p> Not that she regretted wearing the suit in this environment. NGC 6281-34 III, like most of the planetary bodies that long-range sensors had detected in the cluster, was a carbon planet: a world where carbon was the most abundant element in its mineral composition. In carbon-rich protoplanetary disks, graphite, carbides, and other carbon compounds tended to solidify sooner than the silicates that made up the bulk of normal planets, producing worlds with iron cores, carbide mantles, and crusts of graphite and diamond. The resultant surface chemistry was oxygen-poor, with tarry hydrocarbon seas and an atmosphere of carbon monoxide and methane. </p><p> <i>And it looks about as inviting as it sounds</i>, Trys thought as she looked around her through the helmet visor. The rocky ground on which they stood was dark and crumbly, like a carbonaceous asteroid. The depressions in the surface were filled with pools of tar, black against gray-brown. The hazy blue-green sky was smudged with clouds of graphite dust. </p><p> As First Officer Sekmal and the rest of the away team deployed their tricorders, T'Ryssa struck a pose as though planting an invisible flag and proclaimed, "I dub this planet Pencilvania!" </p><p> Sekmal turned to glare at her, raising an eyebrow in that way that Vulcans seemed to be specially trained for. "Explain." </p><p> "Pencil. You know. Old writing implement? Used graphite? It's why graphite's called that? Because people wrote with it?" Sekmal simply continued to glare until Trys sighed. "Never mind," she said, taking out her tricorder. <i>Vulcans</i>. For all their claims of emotionlessness, the Vulcans on <i>Rhea</i> were consistent in their disdain for Trys herself, as though her biology somehow required her to live up to their cultural standards. She could never see the logic in that. </p><p> "I thought it was funny," said Paul Janiss, smiling at her through his helmet. Trys gave him a wan smile of gratitude, knowing it was more likely that he just wanted to flatter her into sleeping with him again. Not that she wouldn't be interested in doing so, at least on a purely physical level, but she preferred more sincerity in her praise, and in her men. </p><p> "Anyway," Paul went on, "it's not like we're going to have any other fun on this dump of a planet. Bleakest hole I ever saw." </p><p> "Don't dismiss it so quickly," said Thyyshev zh'Skenat, the Andorian geologist. "As the galaxy ages and supernovae inject more carbon into the interstellar medium, the ratio of carbon planets to oxygen planets will increase. In a billion years or so, all new planets may be carbon worlds." </p><p> "Thanks, Thyyshev. You just gave me a reason to be glad I'm not immortal." </p><p> "How do you know?" Trys asked. </p><p> "Know what?" </p><p> "That you're not immortal? I mean, there's only one way to know for sure, isn't there?" </p><p> It took Paul a moment. "Oh! Good one." </p><p> "On the other hand," Trys went on as if he hadn't spoken, "there's no way to prove anyone really <i>is</i> immortal either. Just that they haven't died yet. Kind of a meaningless category, really. Maybe it needs a better name. Like 'mortality challenged.'" </p><p> Thyyshev's antennae twisted under his specially designed helmet. "Aren't you supposed to be doing your duty...</p></p><h2>In The Shadow Of The Reich</h2><p>An inside portrait of the Third Reich by the son of Hans Frank, an executed Nazi war criminal, condemns his father and his Nazi contemporaries in a collection of painful memories that follow the &#34;monsterization&#34; of Hans Frank</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: GermanA bitter and often shocking memoir of Hans Frank, Nazi Governor-General of Poland, by his journalist son. Beginning with the fact, learned apparently from an aunt, that his mother had no orgasm when he was conceived, and proceeding on to a detailed discussion of his father's execution after he was convicted of war crimes at Nuremberg, including speculation as to the quality of the sound when his father's neck snapped, Frank gives a chronological account of his father's checkered career. A lawyer with dreams of grandeur, the elder Frank participated in a minor way in Hitler's abortive Putsch in 1923. He caught the F hrer's eye when he defended some Nazi hooligans, and thereafter his ascent was rapid: Bavarian Minister of Justice; President of the Academy for German Justice; Reich Commissioner for Justice; Minister of the Reich--all while still in his 30s. His first compromise with evil lay in his acquiescence in the murder of S.A. leader Rohm and a number of his associates shortly after Hitler's rise to power. Frank's moral decline after becoming Governor- General of Poland was rapid: ``There is no reason for us to be squeamish when we hear about seventeen thousand people being shot,'' he told one audience. Deeply corrupt--they extorted furs and antiques from wealthy Jews--he and his wife laid themselves open to blackmail by Himmler. The son was seven years old when he had a last view of his father, visiting him in the death cell. Unfortunately, the cruelty of the father is matched by a certain cruelty in the son, and the format of the book, an extended conversation with the elder Frank in which the younger mocks and denounces his father's life, diminishes both the subject and the sympathy we would otherwise have for the son.

Unconventional in form--Aragon consciously avoided recognizable narration or character development--<i>Paris Peasant</i> is, in the author's words, &#x201c;a mythology of the modern.&#x201d; The book uses the city of Paris as a stage or framework, and Aragon interweaves his text with images of related ephemera: caf� menus, maps, inscriptions on monuments and newspaper clippings. A detailed description of a Parisian arcade (nineteenth-century precursor to the mini-mall) and another of the Buttes-Chaumont park, are among the great set pieces within Aragon's swirling prose of philosophy, dream and satire. Andr� Breton wrote of this work: &#x201c;no one could have been a more astute detector of the unwonted in all its forms; no one else could have been carried away by such intoxicating reveries about a sort of secret life of the city. . . .&#x201d;</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Reclaim Your Heart</h2><p>Reclaim Your Heart is not just a self-help book. It is a manual about the journey of the heart in and out of the ocean of this life. It is a book about how to keep your heart from sinking to the depths of that ocean, and what to do when it does. It is a book about redemption, about hope, about renewal. Every heart can heal, and each moment is created to bring us closer to that transformative return. Reclaim Your Heart is about finding that moment when everything stops and suddenly looks different. It is about finding your own awakening. And then returning to the better, truer, and freer version of yourself. Many of us live our lives, entrapped by the same repeated patterns of heartbreak and disappointment. Many of us have no idea why this happens. Reclaim Your Heart is about freeing the heart from this slavery. It is about the journey in an out of life&#39;s most deceptive traps. This book was written to awaken the heart and provide a new perspective on love, loss, happiness, and pain. Providing a manual of sorts, Reclaim Your Heart will teach readers how to live in this life without allowing life to own you. It is a manual of how to protect your most prized possession: the heart.</p><p></p><h2>The Last Juror</h2><p>Long before his name became synonymous with the modern legal thriller, John Grisham was working 60-70 hours a week at a small Southaven, Mississippi law practice, squeezing in time After graduating from law school at Ole Miss in 1981, he went on to practice law for nearly a decade in Southaven, specializing in criminal defense and personal injury litigation. One day at the DeSoto County courthouse, Grisham overheard the harrowing testimony of a twelve-year-old rape victim and was inspired to start a novel exploring what would have happened if the girl&#39;s father had murdered her assailants. Getting up at 5 a.m. every day to get in several hours of writing time before heading off to work, Grisham spent three years on A Time to Kill and finished it in 1987. Initially rejected by many publishers, it was eventually bought by Wynwood Press, who gave it a modest 5,000 copy printing and published it in June 1988. When he sold the film rights to The Firm to Paramount Pictures for $600,000, Grisham suddenly became a hot property among publishers, and book rights were bought by Doubleday. Spending 47 weeks on The New York Times bestseller list, The Firm became the bestselling novel of 1991.The successes of The Pelican Brief, which hit number one on the New York Times bestseller list, and The Client, which debuted at number one, confirmed Grisham&#39;s reputation as the master of the legal thriller. Grisham&#39;s success even renewed interest in A Time to Kill, which was republished in hardcover by Doubleday and then in paperback by Dell. This time around, it was a bestseller. Since first publishing A Time to Kill in 1988, Grisham has written one novel a year (his other books are The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client, The Chamber, The Rainmaker, The Runaway Jury, The Partner, The Street Lawyer, The Testament, The Brethren, A Painted House, Skipping Christmas, The Summons, The King of Torts, Bleachers, The Last Juror, The Broker, Playing for Pizza, and The Appeal)</p><p></p><h2>The Letters of Gustave Flaubert: 1830-1857</h2><p><p>Gustave Flaubert wrote to his mistress, Louise Colet: &#x201c;An author in his book must be like God in the universe, present everywhere and visible nowhere.&#x201d; In his books, Flaubert sought to observe that principle; but in his many impassioned letters he allowed his feelings to overflow, revealing himself in all of his human complexity. Sensuous, witty, exalted, ironic, grave, analytical, the letters illustrate the artist&#x2019;s life&#x2015;and they trumpet his artistic opinions&#x2015;in an outpouring of uninhibited eloquence.</p><p>An acknowledged master of translation, Francis Steegmuller has given us by far the most generous and varied selection of Flaubert&#x2019;s letters in English. He presents these with an engrossing narrative that places them in the context of the writer&#x2019;s life and times. We follow Flaubert through his unhappy years at law school, through his tumultuous affair with Louise Colet; we share his days and nights amid the temples and brothels of Egypt, then on to Palestine, Turkey, Greece, and Rome. And the letters chronicle one of the central events in literary history&#x2015;the conception and composition of what has been called the first modern novel, <i>Madame Bovary</i>. Steegmuller&#x2019;s selection concludes with Flaubert&#x2019;s standing trial for immoral writing, <i>Madame Bovary</i>&#x2019;s immediate popular success, and Baudelaire&#x2019;s celebration of its psychological and literary power.</p><p>Throughout this exposition in Flaubert&#x2019;s own words of his views on life, literature, and the passions, readers of his novels will be powerfully reminded of the fertility of his genius, and delighted by his poetic enthusiasm. &#x201c;Let us sing to Apollo as in ancient days,&#x201d; he wrote to Louise Colet, &#x201c;and breathe deeply of the fresh cold air of Parnassus; let us strum our guitars and clash our cymbals and whirl like dervishes in the eternal hubbub of forms and ideas!&#x201d;</p><p>Flaubert&#x2019;s letters are documents of life and art; lovers of literature and of the literary adventure can rejoice in this edition.</p></p><p><p>Francis Steegmuller is the author of more than twenty books and a recipient of numerous awards and honors.

Tour.</p><p>Possessing scholarly credentials, influence, friends, and connections, "wonder boy of the art world" Hoving was the seventh director of the diverse and dazzling Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1967 to 1977. In this, his fifth book, he colorfully chronicles the behind-the-scenes activities, associations, and dealings in his indefatigable lust to make the Met the "encyclopedia of mankind's visual genius." During his tenure, the Met underwent the most comprehensive growth in its 97-year history. Besides landing collections, "gallivanting around . . . thinking up exhibitions, raising funds, and recruiting," this salesman extraordinaire spent "heady days dreaming up architectural solutions and dueling political dragons." As in King of the Confessors ( LJ 10/1/81), Hoving's style is often self-congratulatory, though he admits what he views as his flaws.

The most iconic works of Roy Lichtenstein (1923-1997) are widely known, reproduced, copied, and even parodied. However, the true diversity and complexity of his oeuvre is little understood, and the full scope of his career is largely absent from the existing literature. Presenting over 130 paintings and sculptures, as well as over thirty seldom- or never-before-seen drawings and collages, this book examines all periods in Lichtenstein&#39;s career, going well beyond his brushstrokes and the classic Pop romance and war cartoon paintings that made him famous. Roy Lichtenstein: A Retrospective features exciting new scholarship by an international team of distinguished curators, critics, and art historians. Essays by Yve-Alain Bois, Chrissie Iles, and Stephen Little, among others, give special consideration to Lichtenstein&#39;s historical influences, from Picasso and Cubism through Surrealism, Futurism, and British Pop. Contributions by James Rondeau and Sheena Wagstaff evaluate the artist&#39;s abstract work and late nudes. Complemented by photographs of the artist and his seminal exhibitions, the essays examine the various styles and subjects featured in paintings created throughout his lifetime. The inclusion of a complete chronology of Lichtenstein&#39;s life and work-compiled by Clare Bell of the Lichtenstein Foundation-makes this retrospective the most authoritative publication on the artist since his death in 1997.</p><p></p><h2>The Black Panthers Speak</h2><p>From its founding in 1966 to contemporary attempts to censure its history and revise its significance, the Black Panther party has aroused fear, hope, pride, vilification, and government-sponsored oppression. The trials of Huey Newton, the Chicago Eight, and the Panther 21 made it enormously difficult for many Americans to distinguish the propaganda from the philosophy; the media&#39;s indifference to the Panthers&#39; free breakfast programs, neighborhood clinics, and liberation schools only complicated the problem.This is the first and only collection of the most vital, representative writings of the party. Here are Huey P. Newton, Bobby Seale, Eldridge Cleaver, David Hilliard, and Fred Hampton; Kathleen Cleaver and other Panther women; the party&#39;s court battles and acquittals; its positions on black separatism, the power structure, the police, violence, and education; as well as songs, poems, and political cartoons.

With the craft of a storyteller, Erin shows how she first dismissed, then entertained, rumors of her mother&#x2019;s sexual hypocrisy, and suggests that the strain of maintaining a fa�ade of perfection fueled her mother&#x2019;s departure from reality.<br>The taut narrative hangs on an intense combination of health crises and external pressures that drove Guru Ma&#x2019;s increasingly dire prophecies. Throughout the book, Erin also candidly recounts her own journey, the dwindling of her belief, and the turmoil of witnessing her beloved mother&#x2019;s decline. In a moving conclusion, she describes her efforts to combat the subtle corruption brought on by Guru Ma&#x2019;s power and increasing isolation, only to be thwarted by the onset of her mother&#x2019;s Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease.<br>A remarkable memoir, <i>Prophet&#x2019;s Daughter</i> affords a rare look inside the workings of a secretive sect that once held a nation&#x2019;s attention and still exists today. And it makes a powerful contribution to ongoing public debates about power, group behavior, and the future of religion.<b>For the first time, the truth about what went on inside a secretive sect during an event that gripped the nation by the daughter and onetime heir apparent of its founder</b><br> Books by former members of so-called destructive cults&#x2019; in particular, those by the children of their founders tend to focus on resentments, oppressions, and family dysfunctions. The reader gets no sense of why anyone would want to follow such a leader. Erin Prophet&#x2019;s account is different. Having read it, I really feel that I have seen Elizabeth Clare Prophet and the Church Universal and Triumphant as fully and realistically as possible.&#x201d;<br> Lowell D.

Yet in the low center of the state is a near wilderness, larger than most national parks, which has been known since the seventeenth century as the Pine Barrens.</p><p>The term refers to the predominant trees in the vast forests that cover the area and to the quality of the soils below, which are too sandy and acid to be good for farming. On all sides, however, developments of one kind or another have gradually moved in, so that now the central and integral forest is reduced to about a thousand square miles. Although New Jersey has the heaviest population density of any state, huge segments of the Pine Barrens remain uninhabited. The few people who dwell in the region, the "Pineys," are little known and often misunderstood. Here McPhee uses his uncanny skills as a journalist to explore the history of the region and describe the people&#x2015;and their distinctive folklore&#x2015;who call it home.</p></p><p>Contrary to popular opinion, the whole of New Jersey is not a continuous Superfund site enlivened solely by poorly labeled Turnpike exits and skanky diners. In fact, the largest essentially untouched wilderness east of the Mississippi comprises nearly half the state: the New Jersey Pine Barrens. This more than 1,000-square-mile region has only a few thousand inhabitants--the Pineys, whose way of life has remained essentially unchanged since the 17th century. McPhee--one of the finest American essayists of the 20th century--has written an extraordinarily compelling, informative, and insightful book about the botanical, cultural, hydrological, and historical peculiarities of this region. He also details the efforts to save it from the creeping urbanization of nearby Philadelphia and New York City. Very Highly Recommended.<p><b>John McPhee</b> was born in Princeton, New Jersey, and was educated at Princeton University and Cambridge University.

His Latin translation of Winnie-the-Pooh, which took seven years to complete, was published in the UK in 1960 and immediately became a bestseller. A.A. Milne wrote some 18 plays and three novels, and fathered a son, Christopher Robin Milne, in 1920. Christopher led Milne to produce a book of children&#39;s poetry, When We Were Very Young, in 1924, and in 1926 the seminal Winnie-the-Pooh. More poems followed in Now We Are Six (1927) and Pooh returned in The House at Pooh Corner (1928). E. H. Shepard famously illustrated both Winnie-the-Pooh and The Wind in the Willows though, like A.

The same clouds are rolling over Berlin: where plans for a military coup are forming among a cadre of Wehrmacht officers. Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, head of the Military Intelligence, is gripped by a deadly paralysis: he is neither with the plotters nor against them.

I was terrified, having revered her for so many years expected her to be some sort of Olympian goddess. To my delight, she was incredibly down to earth, and extraordinarily appreciative of my service. After every plate of food and every new bottle of wine, she'd tell me how lovely everything was. At the end of the night, she told me I was lovely as well. It was one of the greatest tables of my lengthy career. Now, many years later, I'm the editor for this book. I doubt if she remembers the younger me, but I'll never forget her generosity, which she still has in abundance.<br>A.

As many of you know, my journey started back in 2011 after I was diagnosed with an illness called Postural Tachycardia Syndrome. It had a pretty devastating effect on my life, both mentally and physically. I started reading all I could find about the link between diet and lifestyle, and the way they can help manage illnesses. I was incredibly inspired by what I was learning and decided to change my life by adopting a whole-foods, plant-based diet and removing most processed foods from my meals.<br> <br>Slowly but surely, I began to regain control of my symptoms. It took me about two years, but eventually I came off my medication, and I&#x2019;ve been working on stabilizing the condition ever since. I have recurrences every now and again, but I&#x2019;m now able to live the life that I want to and no longer feel held back by this chronic illness. It&#x2019;s been a challenging but incredibly empowering process. I never thought I&#x2019;d be a businesswoman or an entrepreneur, but over the last few years my husband, Matthew, and I have spent all of our waking time creating a company in London that is passionate about natural food, the environment and social responsibility. Our passion is to change the conversation and perception around natural food.<br> <br>Deliciously Ella has always served two purposes&#x2014;inspiring me to learn to cook and giving me a positive outlet, both of which hugely helped me to become the person I am today. Sharing what I was learning was my way of turning a negative into a positive and it&#x2019;s been truly amazing to see so many people enjoy the recipes. More than anything I&#x2019;ve wanted to use this space to show how easy it is to create beautiful, nourishing and, most important, delicious meals from simple, natural ingredients.<br> <br>As the community grew, so did my following in the United States&#x2014;a country I count as one of my major sources of inspiration. I spent a few months living in Venice Beach in 2014 and was incredibly energized by the food scene there. It&#x2019;s influenced so much of what Matt and I have done so far&#x2014;with our delis in London, with the cookbooks and the app&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m really excited to start spending more time in the US and to get to know you all!<br> <br>INTRODUCTION<br> <br>Over the last few years healthy eating has really grown in popularity, which has been wonderful to watch! It&#x2019;s given me such a thrill to see people realize how good they feel when they eat foods that nourish their bodies. The best part of it all, though, is that everyone&#x2019;s started to see how incredibly delicious healthy living can be. The stereotype that it&#x2019;s all about lettuce and cucumber is vanishing and is being replaced with dreamy visions of blueberry pancake stacks with caramelized banana bites and crunchy cacao and almond butter, bowls of creamy sweet potato noodles with satay sauce, mango and mushroom ceviche and chocolate orange tart.<br> <br>So many of my readers say that they love eating whole foods and incorporating plant-based meals into their routine . . . but that their husbands, wives, children, friends and colleagues are more skeptical and, as a result, they&#x2019;re not particularly open-minded about trying new, veggie-laden dishes. Lots of people also struggle to know what to cook and how to put menus together when they&#x2019;re entertaining, especially when they&#x2019;re new to this way of eating. When I first started eating a plant-based diet, I found it hard to know which dishes would complement each other best. I got it really wrong a few times with my friends and I&#x2019;m pretty sure they left the table thinking I was a bit mad! The good news is that this book is designed to solve both these issues.<br> <br>Each chapter is focused on delicious meals. I&#x2019;ve got your mornings covered with brunches and breakfasts, followed by lighter meals that work well on the go; big healthy feasts and celebration menus; essential side dishes, party staples and, of course, everyone&#x2019;s favorite&#x2014;desserts. I&#x2019;ve also given meal suggestions that cater to your every sociable need: think brunch for the girls, or a grab-and-go breakfast, pantry saviors, delights for your desk, cold-weather comforters, Mexican fiestas and even dishes&#x2014;such as a knockout Sunday lunch&#x2014;designed to impress the skeptics in your life! So once you&#x2019;ve worked your way through the book you&#x2019;ll feel inspired, knowing exactly how to put Deliciously Ella&#x2013;style meals together in a way that persuades your friends and family to try some healthy versions of their favorites. Plus, you&#x2019;ll get to cook more than one hundred delicious new recipes. We&#x2019;ll be making so many lovely things, from peanut butter and jelly cake to quesadillas stuffed with garlicky beans, cashew sour cream, salsa and guacamole; almond butter rocky roads; pea, zucchini and coconut risotto; chickpea chili with baked sweet potatoes; and chocolate peanut butter pie! Get ready: this is a seriously tasty book.<br> <br>We&#x2019;ll start with my favorite breakfast and brunch recipes: think on-the-go menus with crumbly blueberry squares, roasted almond butter bars and honey and lemon breakfast bars. Or awesome savory brunches with stacks of sweet potato r�sti piled high with maple and rosemary butter beans and spread with a thick layer of herby guacamole. We&#x2019;re also having toasted buckwheat and coconut granola with zesty mango and pineapple bowls and passion fruit yogurt, as well as baked garlicky tomatoes, scrambled turmeric and red pepper tofu and thyme fried mushrooms. There&#x2019;s a great range of options, from easy dishes you can throw together to help rushed mornings when you&#x2019;re time poor, to fancy brunches to share on lazy weekends.<br> <br>We&#x2019;ll then go through some fantastic lighter recipes that work well for quick weekday suppers, as well as portable lunches. We&#x2019;ll look at fresh bites like mango and mushroom ceviche and sushi rolls filled with cauliflower rice, sesame and avocado; after-work catch-up menus of spiced potato cakes with garlicky tomato sauce and green beans; and perfect picnics with charred coconut corn and vibrant salads filled with mango, pepper, cucumber and a peanut dressing. This chapter is full of my go-to meals, quick and easy, but still so delicious! The chile and ginger pho, sesame slaw, pistachio and apricot quinoa and sesame and maple summer rolls are real favorites here. I make these for Matt and me during the week when we&#x2019;re at home, or when I have a couple of girlfriends coming over for weekday supper.<br> <br>The next chapter is all about hearty feasts and celebrations. These are the meals I make when I have lots of friends and family over, or want to impress someone! I promise all these dishes and menus will convince any skeptic that eating well can be pretty amazing. There&#x2019;s a great selection of ideas in here, from Mexican-themed feasts, to curries with homemade lime pickle, to warming meals of tomato and eggplant bake served alongside bowls of spinach with mustard seeds. We then cover everything from garden parties filled with charred cauliflower steaks on a bed of chile quinoa and sun-dried tomato and butter bean hummus, to comforting bowls of three-bean stew with mango salsa, to simple, inexpensive suppers of spiced chickpea chili stuffed into baked sweet potatoes. There&#x2019;s really something for everyone.<br> <br> <br> <br>After this we move toward side dishes. This is probably my favorite chapter of the book as there&#x2019;s such a wide range of ingredients, flavors and textures here. I absolutely love using these as traditional sides, but it&#x2019;s also fun to make a few of these recipes and throw them into a bowl together to make a full meal. It always looks beautiful and tastes sensational. I have so many much-loved recipes in this chapter, but the baked plantains with a sweet chile sauce, the smashed potatoes with turmeric and mustard seeds, the miso and sesame glazed eggplants and the spicy baked avocado fries with their lime, cashew and cilantro dip are all absolute winners . . . and you all should try them. I have a feeling that they&#x2019;ll become staples in your diet too. There&#x2019;s a good mix of impressive and simple dishes in this chapter, so there should be something to suit every taste bud and every occasion. The other great thing about the recipes in this chapter is that you can mix and match them with just about anything, so if you&#x2019;re not ready to go fully Deliciously Ella, then just add these to your existing go-to meals. That way you can experiment with new ingredients without it all feeling too new and overwhelming. If you&#x2019;re a meat eater, then these are great ways to incorporate a bit more plant-based goodness into your diet too, and hopefully they&#x2019;ll get you excited about how good veggies can taste.<br> <br>To make things more fun I&#x2019;ve dedicated a whole chapter to parties; we&#x2019;ve got nibbles, cocktails and mocktails and even birthday teas! You&#x2019;ll be able to serve a lovely array of little bites, from charred Padr�n peppers with chipotle cream to bowls of smoky baked tortilla chips with babaganoush, eggplant rolls with a minty coconut tzatziki and mini baked potatoes with cashew sour cream and chives, as well as mini socca pizza bites. To accompany them there&#x2019;s a list of mocktails and cocktails, so you and your friends can sip on sparkling pineapple and cayenne drinks, or watermelon and cucumber coolers as you catch up. And to end the chapter we&#x2019;ve got a beautiful afternoon tea with iced ginger muffins, a banana and raisin cake and simple cucumber and lemon butter bean hummus open sandwiches, as well as a birthday tea with peanut butter and honey oat bars, blueberry scones with vanilla coconut cream and a triple-layered celebration cake. I think this chapter will really show your friends and family that healthy eating is accessible, delicious and sociable&#x2014;it&#x2019;s absolutely not about sitting on your own at home every night meditating and eating kale salad! These dishes are amazing if you want to do a big dinner party, too, as they mean you can keep it delicious but with a healthy twist from start to finish!<br> <br>To end the book we&#x2019;ll go through all the best sweet ways to finish a meal. I know how much my readers love sweets and there are some real winners in this chapter, which I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll all really enjoying making, eating and sharing (if there&#x2019;s any left by the time your friends arrive!). We&#x2019;ve got beautiful desserts like pistachio and orange truffles, watermelon and mint granita, pan-fried cardamom and honey apples and berries with creamy chocolate sauce and crushed nuts, which work so well as lighter options at the end of a meal. There are also lots of amazing snacks, from salted maca and tahini fudge, to orange and cardamom cookies and my personal favorite&#x2014;quinoa, hazelnut and cacao bars&#x2014;that work really well on the go. Then, if you&#x2019;re looking for something heartier and more indulgent, there are some wonders for you near the end of the chapter as we move toward chocolate peanut butter pie, glazed orange polenta cake and even a sticky toffee pudding. There&#x2019;s so much here for everyone, and I&#x2019;m sure these will all go over really well with your friends and family.<br> <br>Hopefully the recipes, ideas and menus that you&#x2019;ll see throughout the book will inspire you to get cooking, so that you can enjoy amazing food with the people you love. Of course, you don&#x2019;t have to use the book in this way; I pull out single recipes and make them on their own all the time, as they&#x2019;re all so great and obviously you won&#x2019;t necessarily want to make a full three-course meal every night! I&#x2019;ve just put them together to help you work out what goes well with what, so that you feel confident in the kitchen.<br> <br>HOW TO MAKE HEALTHY EATING APPROACHABLE FOR EVERYONE<br> <br>While I am on the subject of sharing food with others, including those who might be more skeptical about eating plant-based food, the other point I&#x2019;d like to highlight is that eating well is not about labels, guilt or enforcing a certain way of eating on yourself or anyone else. It&#x2019;s so important to remember this, especially when you&#x2019;re introducing your friends and family to this kind of food, as you don&#x2019;t want them to feel too overwhelmed and daunted by the concept.<br> <br>The way we eat is so personal to us, and we are all different. We have different bodies, different medical histories, different genes, different lifestyles and different tastes. I do believe that everyone is better off&#x2014;both physically and mentally&#x2014;with a diet full of fruit, veg, nuts, seeds, beans, legumes, healthy grains, and less refined sugar and processed food . . . but, after that, you have to make your own decisions, and it&#x2019;s OK if these are different from the choices made by your friends and family. Only you know what&#x2019;s practical, enjoyable and sustainable for your lifestyle and, as with anything in life, the way you eat doesn&#x2019;t fall into a one-size-fits-all bucket.<br> <br>Healthy eating is about finding a way of eating that makes you happy. It&#x2019;s about meals that make you feel your best&#x2014;that might mean a crumbly blueberry square for breakfast, a lemony potato and butter bean salad for lunch . . . and then a pizza with wine for dinner with friends&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s totally OK. It&#x2019;s your body and your life. Yes, I want to encourage everyone to show their bodies some love and take good care of them, but I never ever want anyone to feel guilty because they&#x2019;re not eating &#x201c;perfectly&#x201d; all the time. Plus, there is no such thing as perfect&#x2014;perfect is simply finding a balance that is right for you, whatever that is.<br> <br>This book is all about natural, plant-based food and the recipes are all vegetarian and wheat-free, but there are no labels on any of it. It&#x2019;s simply about delicious food that&#x2019;s designed to help you feel good, and you can adapt any of it. As you read this book, please don&#x2019;t feel you have to put yourself firmly into any dietary &#x201c;category.&#x201d; Putting yourself in a certain box with a specific label can be quite restrictive. You just shouldn&#x2019;t feel that you&#x2019;re not healthy if you&#x2019;re not specifically raw, plant-based, Paleo, grain-free, gluten-free, wheat-free or any of the rest of it. You can absolutely be a bit of everything, you just have to be honest with yourself and work out what makes you feel best . . . and that might be a happy mix of everything. Of course it can also mean following a certain concept, but please don&#x2019;t feel as though it&#x2019;s wrong if you don&#x2019;t. Likewise, you shouldn&#x2019;t expect anyone else you know and love to categorize themselves either. Don&#x2019;t forget that healthy eating should never be prescriptive or restricting!<br> <br>The other thing to note is that we also all want to commit to healthy eating to different extents and that&#x2019;s great. I eat the way I do because I love it, but also because it&#x2019;s the only way that I&#x2019;m able to manage my illness. I want to&#x2014;and have to&#x2014;eat nourishing food all the time. Just because I eat this way every day, though, doesn&#x2019;t mean you should feel bad if you don&#x2019;t. Similarly, you shouldn&#x2019;t inflict guilt on anyone else if they&#x2019;re not ready to eat healthily all day long either, just focus on encouraging them to add more natural foods to their diet and celebrate the small steps and changes that they&#x2019;re making rather than focusing on the other things you feel they could be doing. We all respond so much better to positivity than negativity.<br> <br>So please remember that when you&#x2019;re introducing friends and family to this food, it&#x2019;s important to let them know that it&#x2019;s totally OK to be a flexible healthy eater and that&#x2014;just because you live with someone or spend a lot of time together&#x2014;it doesn&#x2019;t mean you have to eat i...</p><h2>Perfect Challenge (Thoroughbred Series #52)</h2><p><p>Melanie Graham knows Image is Triple Crown material.

With insight, compassion, and a portraitist&#x2019;s genius, Perry illuminates the shifting tide of emotions encompassing Queen Victoria&#x2019;s London and the people who live there&#x2014;aristocrats, brothel owners, thieves, Dickensian ruffians, and their evil keepers. She takes us through dangerous backstreets where the poor eke out their humble livings, and into the mansions of the rich, safe and secure in their privileged lives. Or so they believe. . . .<br><br>William Monk knows London&#x2019;s streets like the back of his hand; after all, they are where he earns his living.

Why did he warn Monk not to investigate the murder of one of the <i>Maude Idris</i> crew?

Neither Hester nor Monk anticipates the nightmare answers to these questions . . . nor the trap that soon so fatefully ensnares them.<br><br>In this magnificent novel, Anne Perry holds the reader spellbound, as Monk and Hester struggle to save themselves and their world from a catastrophe whose dimensions they can scarcely measure.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>Commissioned to find the precious cargo of ivory stolen by river thieves from the hold of Clement Louvain's ocean-going schooner, private enquiry agent William Monk is intrigued by his new surroundings. The waterfront of the River Thames is a world unto itself, but without the help of the famed River Police, Monk hardly stands a chance of retrieving the ivory or tracking down the murderous men who killed an innocent crew member while robbing Louvain's ship. Not so coincidentally, Monk's wife Hester, who operates a shelter for sick and injured women of the streets, discovers that a woman with a mysterious connection to Louvain may hold the key to the missing ivory as well as many more deaths aboard his ship than the one Monk knows about. Perry's trademarked plotting, characterization, and verisimilitude in recreating Victorian London gleam brilliantly in this well-crafted historical mystery. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Among <b>Anne Perry</b>&#x2019;s other novels featuring investigator William Monk are <i>Death of a Stranger</i>, <i>Funeral in Blue</i>, <i>Slaves of Obsession</i>, and <i>The Twisted Root</i>.

W. Brands, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b><br> <br><b>An astonishing untold story from America&#x2019;s past&#x2014;a sweeping, powerful, and necessary work of history that reads like<i> Gone with the Wind </i>for the Cherokee.</b><br><br><i>Blood Moon</i> is the story of the century-long blood feud between two rival Cherokee chiefs from the early years of the United States through the infamous Trail of Tears and into the Civil War. The two men&#x2019;s mutual hatred, while little remembered today, shaped the tragic history of the tribe far more than anyone, even the reviled President Andrew Jackson, ever did. Their enmity would lead to war, forced removal from their homeland, and the devastation of a once-proud nation.<br> <br> It begins in the years after America wins its independence, when the Cherokee rule expansive lands of the Southeast that encompass eight present-day states. With its own government, language, newspapers, and religious traditions, it is one of the most culturally and socially advanced Native American tribes in history. But over time this harmony is disrupted by white settlers who grow more invasive in both number and attitude.<br> <br> In the midst of this rising conflict, two rival Cherokee chiefs, different in every conceivable way, emerge to fight for control of their people&#x2019;s destiny. One of the men, known as The Ridge&#x2014;short for He Who Walks on Mountaintops&#x2014;is a fearsome warrior who speaks no English but whose exploits on the battlefield are legendary. The other, John Ross, is descended from Scottish traders and looks like one: a pale, unimposing half-pint who wears modern clothes and speaks not a word of Cherokee. At first, the two men are friends and allies. To protect their sacred landholdings from white encroachment, they negotiate with almost every American president from George Washington through Abraham Lincoln. But as the threat to their land and their people grows more dire, they break with each other on the subject of removal, breeding a hatred that will lead to a bloody civil war within the Cherokee Nation, the tragedy and heartbreak of the Trail of Tears, and finally, the two factions battling each other on opposite sides of the US Civil War.<br> <br> Through the eyes of these two primary characters, John Sedgwick restores the Cherokee to their rightful place in American history in a dramatic saga of land, pride, honor, and loss that informs much of the country&#x2019;s mythic past today. It is a story populated with heroes and scoundrels of all varieties&#x2014;missionaries, gold prospectors, linguists, journalists, land thieves, schoolteachers, politicians, and more. And at the center of it all are two proud men, Ross and Ridge, locked in a life-or-death struggle for the survival of their people.<br> <br>This propulsive narrative, fueled by meticulous research in contemporary diaries and journals, newspaper reports, and eyewitness accounts&#x2014;and Sedgwick&#x2019;s own extensive travels within Cherokee lands from the Southeast to Oklahoma&#x2014;brings two towering figures back to life with reverence, texture, and humanity. The result is a richly evocative portrait of the Cherokee that is destined to become the defining book on this extraordinary people.</p><p>John Sedgwick is the bestselling author of thirteen books, including&nbsp;<i>Blood Moon</i>;&nbsp;<i>War of Two,&nbsp;</i>his acclaimed account of the duel between Hamilton and Burr; two novels; and the family memoir&nbsp;<i>In My</i>&nbsp;<i>Blood</i>.

It was also fought by Indians,I as many as 30,000 of them, from the Seneca and Shawnee of the Northeast to the Creeks and Seminoles in the Southwest, nineteen tribes altogether. They fought at Second Bull Run, Antietam, Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Petersburg in the East. But most of their battles were fought west of the Mississippi, beyond the range of the eastern newspapers that covered the war.<br> <br>While the Indians were skilled as scouts, trackers, horsemen, and sharpshooters, their greatest value may have been their fighting skills. Shaped by a warrior culture, most were used to violence, and they took to battle. Their long black hair spilling out from under their caps, their shoddy uniforms ill-fitting, their faces painted in harsh war colors, they surged into battle with a terrifying cry, equipped not just with army-issue rifles but also with hunting knives, tomahawks, and, often, bows and arrows. Even when mounted on horses, they exhibited a deadly aim, and their arrows sank deep, leaving their victims as much astonished as agonized. They&#x2019;d close fast, whip out a tomahawk to dispatch their man, then pounce on the corpse with a bowie knife to shear off a scalp to lift to the sky in triumph. The New York Tribune fulminated against an &#x201c;Aboriginal Corps of Tomahawkers and Scalpers&#x201d; among the rebels, but President Jefferson Davis was not embarrassed enough to order his Indians to stop. The natives killed as Indians, and they often died as Indians, too. When one dwindling band of sharpshooters, fighting for the Union at Petersburg, Virginia, in the yearlong siege at the close of the war, found themselves out of bullets, surrounded by a tightening ring of Confederates, they lifted the blouses of their uniforms over their heads and chanted their tribal death song until the end came.<br> <br>If that is the last big surprise, another one lies hidden within it&#x2014;about the mysterious behavior of the Cherokee in the conflict. Of all the tribes that fought in the Civil War, the Cherokee were one of the very few to come in on both sides, and, of those few, by far the most notable. The internal nature of their own conflict doubled the slaughter, and also drew the fight into their territory, bringing more sweeping devastation. Nearly a dozen battles were fought on Cherokee land, more than on any other Indian territory, starting with Caving Brooks in 1861 and Cowskin Prairie the following year; continuing through Pea Ridge just outside it, the greatest pitched battle in the West; and running through other battlegrounds that have been ignored by history. By the time of the surrender in 1865, the war had devastated the Cherokee Nation.<br> <br>At first, virtually all the Cherokee sided with the Confederacy, identifying with the Southern plantation owners, and proud of the black slaves they themselves had bought to pick their cotton. And, complicit with the state of Georgia, the Union had been responsible for the land theft that had cost them their ancestral territory and packed them west in the forced migration known as the Trail of Tears three decades before.<br> <br>But why did the Cherokee not stay united against a common enemy? How could they have divided against themselves? To answer this, we need go back three decades to the terrible winter of 1838 and the issue that would never go away. Removal&#x2014;the cruel shorthand for the Trail of Tears&#x2014;was to the Cherokee Nation what slavery was to America, an issue so profound as to be bottomless and unending. To the outside world, it pitted the Cherokee against Andrew Jackson and his nefarious Indian Removal Act. To the Cherokee themselves, the matter was more complicated and far more divisive. The Cherokee Nation did not stand as one against the threat of removal; it stood as two, one side agreeing that, given the relentless white encroachment, the Cherokee had to go, and the other insisting that they stay forever, come what may. Stay or go&#x2014;the question could not have been more essential or more agonizing. On this, there could be no compromise. Follow the past, or chase the future? Hold to tradition, or start afresh? Philosophical as these questions might seem, they were as real as children, as houses that had been built by hand, as crops that had been teased from the earth, as the deer that gamboled in the forest, as the sun that rose over the mountains.<br> <br>The two sides were given body and voice by two proud Cherokee who loomed over the great debate like two great peaks on either side of a valley split by a raging river: John Ross and a man known as The Ridge. One the longtime principal chief, the other his primary councillor, and then his fiercest opponent. Their philosophies and personalities were so distinct as to name the two political parties that rose up over the issue. The Ross Party and the Ridge Party. One to stay, the other to go.<br> <br>Everything about them expressed their differences. The Ridge&#x2014;short for He Who Walks on Mountaintops&#x2014;was a big, imposing, copper-skinned Cherokee, a fearsome warrior turned plantation owner, whose voice quieted any room, and whose physique awed anyone who crossed his path. Smaller, almost twenty years younger, Ross was descended from Scottish traders and looked like one: a pale, unimposing half-pint who wore eastern clothes, from laced shoes to a top hat. If The Ridge radiated the power of a Cherokee who could drop a buck at a hundred paces, Ross could have strolled into an Edinburgh dinner party without receiving undue attention. Tellingly, The Ridge spoke almost no English, and Ross almost no Cherokee.<br> <br>Raised at either end of the string of Cherokee settlements from Tennessee down into Alabama, they were each a combination of Cherokee and Scottish, but in radically different proportions, and so demonstrated the startling variety of a seemingly homogeneous population: Cherokee skin ranged from a glowing tan to parchment white. In adulthood, the two men emerged as the two great leaders of the nation, statesmen both, united in their devotion to their Cherokee heritage, although no two men could have seen it more differently. Together, they created the first national Cherokee government, with a constitution, a legislature, and a supreme court, which certified the Cherokee as the most &#x201c;civilized&#x201d; tribe in America.<br> <br>In those halcyon years of the 1820s, the two worked together in backslapping harmony. It wasn&#x2019;t hard to picture them, on a warm evening, sitting together in the shade of the elms under the porch of The Ridge&#x2019;s fine house, sipping whiskey, although both professed not to drink it, and laughing into the night.<br> <br>But President Andrew Jackson&#x2019;s hard push for removal touched something in them&#x2014;a tension over whether to resist or to accommodate&#x2014;that set each against the other, permanently. What started as an honest disagreement between friends developed into an active distrust that hardened into antagonism and then became a blinding hatred that consumed everything. A blood feud, in short, that went from personal vendetta to clan war to a civil war that swept through the entire Cherokee Nation before it got caught up in the even greater cataclysm of the American War Between the States.<br> <br>It was Ross against Ridge, but of course it was much more than that. It was a great battle over the truth about who the Cherokee people really were. The times had given the Cherokee such a shake that they&#x2019;d lost track of themselves. Were they a people of the mountains, believers in the Great Spirit, attuned to the flight of a hawk across the sky? Or were they a people who&#x2019;d largely abandoned their ancestral past, ready to start over with modern ways? Did their passions still run to the wild&#x2014;or to the bright promise of industrial civilization? Did they want what the Cherokee had always wanted, or did they seek something new that would make them new? Identity should be obvious, the face in the mirror. But in their own uncertainty, the Cherokee turned to their leaders to tell them what they thought they were. Two leaders in particular. And, of course, John Ross and The Ridge saw wildly different things&#x2014;tradition-bound for one, enterprising for the other&#x2014;and when they described these, such was the power of their telling that the differences grew, and the two visions became so distinct there was no reconciling them: it was one or the other. And then it got even worse. Each of these two great men grew monstrous in the other&#x2019;s eyes, and so did his ideas, and, following suit, the Cherokee Nation broke into two wrathful countries, each bent on annihilating the other before the other could annihilate it.<br> <br>As for the two men behind all this&#x2014;things went no better for them. And that was the tragedy, right there. Their differences might have added to their understanding and joint strength, but led instead to division and acrimony&#x2014;and ultimately to a disaster that was all the more excruciating because they had inflicted it on themselves. Their tragedy became the tragedy of their own nation, and also the tragedy of the greater nation they so uneasily inhabited.<br> <br>The tragedy did not begin with removal&#x2014;that was simply when the sorrows hit hardest. It began earlier, at The Ridge&#x2019;s birth just before the American Revolution, although its sources could easily be tracked back even earlier. And it took its shape as the Cherokee Nation did, its aspirations rising even as its borders were being squeezed by the settlers pushing in on every side.<br> <br>The resulting pressures on the Cherokee were tremendous, but hardly unique. Their story was the story of all Americans, really, as everyone in this land of emigrants tried to fit into a foreign nation. The difference, of course, was that the Cherokee were not emigrants; they had been here all along. By rights, everyone else should have been trying to get along with them, not the reverse. So, on top of all the other brutal hardships the Cherokee faced in being forcibly removed from their land, there was this one, which was possibly the worst of all: a terrible, grinding, and utterly legitimate sense of injustice that they should have to endure such suffering.<br> <br>I.&nbsp;I use the now somewhat antiquated word &#x201c;Indians&#x201d; because it was universally accepted by the country&#x2019;s indigenous people and everyone else during the period of this book.

Infidelity, faith, and power all come together in a gripping story of the prophet Hosea and his wife, Gomer. This extraordinary literary find includes a foreword by Ari Goldman and commentaries by Harold Kushner and Norma Rosen. <br><br>The Lord said unto Hosea: Go, take unto thee a wife of harlotry and children of harlotry; for the land doth commit great harlotry, departing from the Lord. <br> HOSEA 1:2<br><br>From the moment young Hosea saw the maiden Gomer dancing at the Festival of Booths, he loved her. It was the most beautiful vision he had ever seen, and he would never forget it, despite the scornful laughter of his older brother Iddo, despite the lack of piety of Gomer s household, and despite her admission that she did not love him. <br><br>And so Hosea marries Gomer, in a troubled land where idol-worshiping neighbors offer up their daughters purity in the sacred groves, where arrogant high priests will stop at nothing to silence troublesome prophets, and where the blood of brothers can be the strongest bond, or the most destructive.<br><br>When Milton Steinberg died in 1950, he left one manuscript tantalizingly unfinished. Like As a Driven Leaf, it is grand in scope, while told as a compelling personal tale. Set against a backdrop of unrest in ancient Israel, The Prophet s Wife is a stirring portrait of the biblical prophet Hosea, his passionate and free-spirited wife Gomer, and a people seduced by the lures of power and idolatry to betray their faith.</p><p>ABOUT MILTON STEINBERG<br><br>The late Milton Steinberg is the author of the literary masterpiece As a Driven Leaf, first published in 1939 and still regarded as a major influence on contemporary Jewish life and thought.

His earlier collections are <i>Book of My Nights</i> (BOA Editions, 2001); <i>Rose</i> (BOA, 1986), winner of the Delmore Schwartz Memorial Award from New York University; <i>The City in Which I Love You</i> (BOA, 1991), the 1990 Lamont Poetry Selection; and a memoir entitled <i>The Winged Seed: A Remembrance</i> (Simon and Schuster, 1995), which received an American Book Award from the Before Columbus Foundation. Lee's honors include fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, The Lannan Foundation, and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, as well as grants from the Illinois Arts Council, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts. In 1988 he received the Writer's Award from the Mrs. Giles Whiting Foundation. He is also featured in Katja Esson's documentary, Poetry of Resilience.<br><br>Born in 1957 of Chinese parents in Jakarta, Indonesia, Lee learned early about loss and exile. His great grandfather was China's first republican President; and his father, a deeply religious Christian, was physician to Communist leader Mao Tse-Tung. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Lee's parents escaped to Indonesia. In 1959, his father, after spending a year as a political prisoner in President Sukarno's jails, fled Indonesia with his family to escape anti-Chinese sentiment. After a five-year trek through Hong Kong, Macau, and Japan, they settled in the United States in 1964.<br><br>Through the observation and translation of often unassuming and silent moments, the poetry of Li-Young Lee gives clear voice to the solemn and extraordinary beauty found within humanity. By employing hauntingly lyrical skill and astute poetic awareness, Lee allows silence, sound, form, and spirit to emerge brilliantly onto the page. His poetry reveals a dialogue between the eternal and the temporal, and accentuates the joys and sorrows of family, home, loss, exile, and love. In The City In Which I love You,&#x201d; the central long poem in his second collection, Li-Young Lee asks, Is prayer, then, the proper attitude / for the mind that longs to be freely blown, / but which gets snagged on the barb / called world, that / tooth-ache, the actual?&#x201d; Anyone who has seen him read will add that Lee is also one of the finest poetry readers alive.<br><br>He lives in Chicago with his wife Donna and their two sons.An autobiography at once intimate and sweeping, this work traces the path followed by poet Lee (Rose, BOA Editions, dist. by Consortium, 1986, and The City in Which I Love You, BOA Editions, dist. by Consortium, 1990) and his family. Born into a prominent Chinese family in residence in Jakarta, Lee was shaped by his scholarly father's imprisonment under the virulently anti-Chinese Sukarno; the family odyssey began when they escaped from Indonesia. His father eventually became a preacher in Hong Kong, with his final calling in a church in rust-belt Pennsylvania. Lee interweaves remembrances of incidents from his childhood with dreams, myths, his father's sermons (dimly remembered), and mundane recollections, such as the seeds in his father's coat pocket or the coconut oil in his Indonesian nanny's hair. To the son, the powerful father figure embodied cruelty, Christian kindness, inspiration, deprivation, devotion, and penetrating insight. In this lyrical yet stark rendering of a family of modern China, we see the inner development of the author from his childhood in the 1950s to the present and his adaptation to new world and new perceptions of reality.

He is the coeditor of <em>The Art </em>of <em>Fact: A Historical Anthology </em>of <em>Literary Journalism </em>and is the author of a forthcoming history of <em>The New Yorker.</em></p>Clear as a Walker Evans photo: a biography of folk-humorist Will Rogers (1879-1935), who, like Cary Grant and Humphrey Bogart, grew into his mask, becoming the image of wry, genial common sense until his death. Yagoda (English/University of Delaware) offers an utterly thorough, brilliant taking-apart of the unique Rogers persona. Ronald Reagan, he tells us, gave ``an impressive Rogers impersonation in the White House'' and back in the 40's was thought to be a natural to play Rogers in the film bio--but Will Rogers, Jr., got the role. ``For there to be another Will Rogers today,'' Rogers says, ``he (or she) would have to combine...Johnny Carson, Mark Russell, Roy Rogers, Clark Clifford, Walter Cronkite, Bill Cosby, Bob Hope, Russell Baker, H. Ross Perot, and Walter Lippmann. It just can't happen.'' Yagoda finds Rogers to have been a divided being, a rather gleeful but sometimes despairing and angry youth who clammed up after marriage and became the model of ``unmatched stability, drive and contentment.'' One-quarter Cherokee, he rode the plains as a young cowboy, then took his mastery of the lariat and patter to the vaudeville stage, emerging as the Lincolnesque figure who ``never met a man I didn't like.'' Rogers went on to a rather bumpkin-ish career in silent movies; graduated to a kind of sheepishly patriarchal status in talkies; made records; then became a radio humorist, syndicated newspaper columnist, and crony of politicians while grabbing the ear of FDR and topping out as Hollywood's number-one star: An amazing, unforeseeable life. As a speaker about politics, he kept his knife sheathed, talking as if from the very pulse of the people during the Depression, and was finally seen by all as the apostle of decency and archetype of American wisdom. His interest in aviation led to his death in Alaska--and to the grief of a nation. So immediate you can scratch a match on his boot sole. (Photographs) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It's 1944 when the novel opens on Richard, pegged as an Allied agent, withstanding torture and interrogation at the hands of the Gestapo in a French prison. In his cell in between beatings, he retreats to his memories, which make up the bulk of the novel. The story casts back to his bleak childhood as son of a strict rector and his pretty wife. He studies painting in France, and eventually returns to England, facing the life of a starving artist in London. There, he falls in with a gang of thieves and becomes a forger of famous paintings, drifting along hand-to-mouth until he coincidentally meets Phillipa Bret, a wealthy socialite who becomes his patron and object of desire. By this time, the Nazis have invaded France, and at Philippa's urging, Richard tries to enlist. Poor health leaves him fit only for intelligence-a career switch O'Brian quickly glosses over. This desultory character study will thwart readers looking for action and intrigue.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Although Heine was happiest during his early years in Paris, many of his finest poems were composed during the final years preceding his death in 1856-poetic laments and meditations on the bleak human condition. During those years, Heine's health deteriorated; from the spring of 1848 he was confined to his "mattress-grave," partially blind, paralyzed, and suffering from a venereal disease. For many years Heine was more appreciated and celebrated abroad than in his home country, partly because of his satirical, aggressive writing-which got him into trouble with the German authorities-and partly because of his Jewish origins. Pawel offers here a thorough and expert analysis of one of Germany's most important poets. Strongly recommended.<br><i>Ali Houissa, Cornell Univ., Ithaca, N.Y.</i><br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.The late Pawel, award-winning biographer of Kafka (The Nightmare of Reason), has written a penetrating study of the great poet (1797-1856). The "enfant terrible of German letters" (Nietzsche said, "He possessed that divine malice without which I cannot conceive of perfection"), Heine was an elegant poet and unsparing journalist. His poetry, shaped by banishment from a Germany hostile to his Jewishness and to his pointed irreverence, flourished in Paris. As mysterious ill health overtook him in the last eight years of his life, confining him to his "mattress tomb," Heine confronted death in strikingly understated, carefully controlled verse. He retained his sardonic sense of humor as well: "It is already expensive enough to live in Paris. But dying in Paris is infinitely more expensive. And to think that I could now be hanged for free in Germany or in Hungary." With an appendix of Heine's poems in German and English. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Seed Sowing and Saving: Step-by-Step Techniques for Collecting and Growing More Than 100 Vegetables, Flowers, and Herbs (Storey&#39;s Gardening Skills Illustrated)</h2><p><p>Use seeds from this year&#x2019;s crop to grow your favorite vegetables, herbs, and flowers again next spring.

To live is to be slowly born.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;ANTOINE DE SAINT-EXUP�RY, FLIGHT TO ARRAS<br> <br>It may have been a slow time coming, but one day in 1960, when he was nineteen years old, Robert Allen Zimmerman of Duluth and Hibbing, Minnesota&#x2014;the elder of two sons of Abraham and Beatrice Zimmerman&#x2014;decided to make a name for himself, as well as a nascent identity, a self, and a fantasticated life story nearer to his heart&#x2019;s desire. (This may have been a slow but not totally calculated decision: As he told People magazine in 1975, &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t consciously pursue the Bob Dylan myth. It was given to me by God. Inspiration is what we&#x2019;re looking for. You just have to be receptive to it.&#x201d;)<br> <br>&#x201c;Bob Dylan,&#x201d; he volunteered to his early interviewers, was raised in Gallup, New Mexico&#x2014;he often said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have a family, I&#x2019;m all alone&#x201d;&#x2014;and was a child of the open road, having run away from home seven times&#x2014;at ten, twelve, thirteen, fifteen, fifteen-and-a-half, seventeen, and eighteen. His peregrinations took him to North and South Dakota, Kansas, Texas, California (where at age ten, he claimed to have seen Woody Guthrie perform in Burbank), and even Mexico, thumbing rides and riding freight trains. &#x201c;I danced my way from the Indian festivals in Gallup, New Mexico/To the Mardi Gras in New Orleans, Louisiana,&#x201d; he wrote in his early autobiographical sketch &#x201c;My Life in a Stolen Moment.&#x201d; He traveled with a carnival &#x201c;off and on for six years,&#x201d; he confided to the folksinger Cynthia Gooding in 1962. &#x201c;I was clean-up boy. I was mainliner on the Ferris wheel. Do the shoreline thing. Use to do all kinds of stuff like that.&#x201d; As he told the New York Herald Tribune in 1965, &#x201c;My past is so complicated you wouldn&#x2019;t believe it, man.&#x201d;<br> <br>His life story changed as he proceeded onward in his journey, as, remarkably, did his physiognomy and everyday appearance. Like the Greek sea deity Proteus, who in order to elude his pursuers continually shape-shifted from dragon to lion to fire to flood&#x2014;uttering prophecies along the way&#x2014;Bob Dylan, in his early days, had, according to the folksinger Eric von Schmidt, &#x201c;the most incredible way of changing shape, changing size, changing looks. The whole time&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he wore the same thing, his blue jeans and cap. And sometimes he would look big and muscular, and the next day he&#x2019;d look like a little gnome, and one day he&#x2019;d be kind of handsome and virile, and the following day he&#x2019;d look like a thirteen-year-old child. It was really strange.&#x201d; (One thinks of the advice once given by the ancient Greek elegiac poet Theognis: &#x201c;Present a different aspect of yourself to each of your friends&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Follow the example of the octopus with its many coils which assumes the appearance of the stone to which it is going to cling. Attach yourself to one on one day and, another day, change color. Cleverness is more valuable than inflexibility.&#x201d;)<br> <br>You would also never know what his voice was going to sound like. One of the other fascinating, if obvious, things about Bob Dylan&#x2019;s chameleonic personality was the way the timbre of his voice would change from one record or period of his life to another&#x2014;as if his voice, too, couldn&#x2019;t stand having just one unvarying sound. When he first arrived in New York City, he was singing like a hillbilly, &#x201c;like a dog with his leg caught in barbed wire,&#x201d; as someone remarked at the time. And as years went by, Dylan&#x2019;s voice would veer from, in his words, &#x201c;that thin&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wild mercury sound&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. metallic and bright gold&#x201d; of Blonde on Blonde (1966) to the insouciant country sound, which Dylan attributes to his having stopped smoking cigarettes, of Nashville Skyline (1969) to the openheartedness, gentleness, vulnerability, and anger of Blood on the Tracks (1975) to the haunting timbral admixture of sandpaper and sherry of Time Out of Mind (1997).<br> <br>The French poet Arthur Rimbaud&#x2019;s &#x201c;I is another&#x201d; became Dylan&#x2019;s self-defining (selves-defining) modus vivendi. Reading a newspaper account of himself, he once remarked, &#x201c;God, I&#x2019;m glad I&#x2019;m not me.&#x201d; When asked by a reporter the reason for his wearing a wig and a fake beard at a 2003 Newport Folk Festival concert, Dylan replied, &#x201c;Is that me who you saw up there?&#x201d; In a 1977 interview I conducted with him about his film Renaldo and Clara, Dylan explained to me, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s Renaldo, there&#x2019;s a guy in whiteface singing on the stage, and then there&#x2019;s Ronnie Hawkins playing Bob Dylan. Bob Dylan is listed in the credits as playing Renaldo, yet Ronnie Hawkins is listed as playing Bob Dylan.&#x201d; &#x201c;So Bob Dylan,&#x201d; I surmised, &#x201c;may or may not be in the film.&#x201d; &#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d; &#x201c;But Bob Dylan made the film.&#x201d; &#x201c;Bob Dylan didn&#x2019;t make it,&#x201d; he told me. &#x201c;I made it.&#x201d;<br> <br>He even explored and confessed to the more particulated (some might say self-splitting) nature of his being. &#x201c;Have you ever felt like a couple?&#x201d; the playwright and actor Sam Shepard once asked him. &#x201c;A couple?&#x201d; Dylan responded. &#x201c;You mean two? Yeah. All the time. Sometimes I feel like ten couples.&#x201d; And as he informed Newsweek&#x2019;s David Gates: &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;m tangible to myself. I mean, I think one thing today and I think another thing tomorrow. I change during the course of a day. I wake and I&#x2019;m one person, and when I go to sleep I know for certain I&#x2019;m somebody else. I don&#x2019;t know who I am most of the time. It doesn&#x2019;t even matter to me.&#x201d; (One thinks of the Buddhist notion that the ego isn&#x2019;t an entity but rather a process in time, as well as of Virginia Woolf&#x2019;s comment in Orlando that &#x201c;a biography is considered complete if it merely accounts for six or seven selves, whereas a person may well have as many thousand.&#x201d;)<br> <br>Throughout his career he has played off his role of &#x201c;Bob Dylan&#x201d;&#x2014;&#x201c;I have my Bob Dylan mask on, I&#x2019;m masquerading,&#x201d; he told a Halloween concert audience in 1964&#x2014;against the silent center of his inner life. At a 1986 press conference he said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m only Bob Dylan when I have to be.&#x201d; When asked who he was the rest of the time, he replied, &#x201c;Myself.&#x201d; In an interview with Clinton Heylin, Cesar Diaz, who spent five years working with Dylan as a guitar tech in almost daily proximity to him, said: &#x201c;I&#x2019;d been searching the same guy for years and years. I&#x2019;d get a glimpse of the guy once in a while&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He actually put his cards down a couple of times&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You would have to be with him, and be there at that right moment when he just opens up and says, &#x2018;Okay, I&#x2019;m just Bob and Bob has no last name.&#x2019; &#x201d; And when the mask comes off, as it does in his astonishing song &#x201c;Abandoned Love,&#x201d; his life and his world become transparent both to himself and to us:<br> <br>Everybody&#x2019;s wearing a disguise<br> <br>To hide what they&#x2019;ve got left behind their eyes<br> <br>But me, I can&#x2019;t cover what I am<br> <br>Wherever the children go I&#x2019;ll follow them.<br> <br>The legendary American pianist William Kapell, who died at the age of thirty-one in a 1953 plane crash, once wrote to a friend: &#x201c;The only moments I have when I play that are worth anything to me are when I can blissfully ignore the people I am supposed to be entertaining. No me; no silly public to amuse; only the heart and the soul, the world, the birds, storms, dreams, sadness, heavenly serenity. Then I am an artist worthy of the name&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Until it happens, or if it doesn&#x2019;t happen, I am miserable.&#x201d;<br> <br>Like Kapell, Bob Dylan is one of a number of creative artists who has throughout his life been chary of courting and rewarding his fans&#x2019; sometimes fanatical adulation. As the psychologist Jeffrey Satinover presciently wrote: &#x201c;Once the star is established, his fans will tear him to pieces should ever he fail to carry for them the projected childhood Self. A recent example from pop culture is the fans&#x2019; vituperative reaction to Bob Dylan&#x2019;s unexpected changes of style. Once a narcissistic complementation has been set up between any leader and his following, he is as bound as they. The rigidity of the relationship and the strength of the forces maintaining the status quo stem from the mutual common individual fear of fragmentation.&#x201d; His sense of other people&#x2019;s &#x201c;wanting my soul,&#x201d; as he confessed to Nat Hentoff, has often encouraged Dylan to disappear into himself and to become a stranger to others (and perhaps sometimes to himself as well).<br> <br>&#x201c;A stranger in a strange land,&#x201d; Bob Dylan calls himself in his song &#x201c;You Changed My Life.&#x201d; (An &#x201c;equivocal stranger,&#x201d; like Herman Melville&#x2019;s Confidence Man.) Elusive, oblique, mercurial, and always in motion, he has resisted in both his life and his work being categorized, encapsulated, finalized, conventionalized, canonized, and deified. &#x201c;Greed and lust I can understand,&#x201d; he once said, &#x201c;but I can&#x2019;t understand the values of definition and confinement. Definition destroys.&#x201d; He has therefore always been wary of being entrapped in the amber of interviewers&#x2019; id�es fixes or projected fantasies about himself, of their attempt to pry into and unravel his private life, to murder and to dissect his creative processes.<br> <br>In Inter Views, a fascinating book of conversations with Laura Pozzo, the imaginal psychologist James Hillman expresses his own distrust of the interview form in terms that Bob Dylan might well assent to: &#x201c;Interviews belong to an ego genre: one ego asking another ego. So one thinks one has to proceed in terms of &#x2018;I answer a question&#x2019; and &#x2018;stick to the topic,&#x2019; &#x2018;the given subject,&#x2019; and one tries to say it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you know, nicely, tightly, rationally. &#x2018;Directed thinking&#x2019; it&#x2019;s called in psychiatry. All ego. Now, the kind of psychology that I want to do is not addressed to the ego. It is to evoke imagination, it&#x2019;s to be extremely complex, it&#x2019;s to talk with emotion and from emotion and to emotion; so how can you, in an interview, bring in that complexity? How can you speak to the whole psyche at the same time?&#x201d;<br> <br>How does one, therefore, go about interviewing someone as mutable and multiple as Bob Dylan&#x2014;a person who once sang, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t ask me nothin&#x2019; about nothin&#x2019;/I might just tell you the truth&#x201d; (&#x201c;Outlaw Blues&#x201d;), someone who doesn&#x2019;t give himself (or his self) up lightly?<br> <br>Mikal Gilmore, who conducted five interviews with Dylan, comments: &#x201c;His reputation precedes him, more than anybody I&#x2019;ve ever encountered. And like so many others, I&#x2019;ve seen varying documentations of what that reputation is based on. In his appearance in Don&#x2019;t Look Back, he has a conversation with a young man who&#x2019;s referred to as a science student, and he asks Dylan what&#x2019;s his attitude when he first meets somebody, and Dylan says, &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t like them.&#x2019; And in that and other documentations both in film and on the page you expect someone who can be pretty sharp and acerbic. But in my initial meeting with him I was relieved early on in our conversation. There were moments when some of that pride and flair could rise up. But on that occasion he was generous and relaxed.<br> <br>&#x201c;The first time I talked to him was between the release of Infidels and Biograph when I was working at the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner. I was initially supposed to see him at his house out in Malibu, but he ended up just coming over to my apartment in West Hollywood. It was a nervous-making prospect having him visit me at my place. I anticipated an hour&#x2019;s length conversation but he stayed for four or five hours, just sitting on my sofa. We had a couple of beers, and I found him amazingly gracious and relaxed, maybe because it was the change of environment that didn&#x2019;t focus on his world so much&#x2014;it may be that he might have been more guarded if someone came to his home. I talked to him several times after that over the years, and that was pretty much my experience except for one occasion when we got into an argument about something, but even then, at the end of that moment, he lapsed back into being the gracious host.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always felt that there are parts of himself that he doesn&#x2019;t give up easily, if at all, in an interview. I don&#x2019;t think he gives it up even in Chronicles, which is an autobiography of the mind. There are parts of his experience and frame of mind that he doesn&#x2019;t go into readily&#x2014;he may eventually, though I don&#x2019;t think he has yet. But it must not be easy facing questions asking you to analyze yourself and your work and how you&#x2019;ve measured up in cultural expectations, because not only can that be so grueling personally, but it must take a toll on one&#x2019;s will to be an artist.&#x201d;<br> <br>Robert Hilburn, who has interviewed Dylan ten times for The Los Angeles Times, remarks: &#x201c;Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan were the two people I was most nervous about ever meeting because they were such heroes of mine. And I had seen Don&#x2019;t Look Back and read about how he was difficult and mysterious and manipulative in interviews. So you bring a nervousness to an interview with him, thinking, My goodness, if I say the wrong thing we&#x2019;re not going to connect. So I think the writer brings a lot of preconceptions to it that sometimes make it difficult to have a conversation with him.<br> <br>&#x201c;In his mind, he&#x2019;s seen himself misused in the press, with people misunderstanding or trying to label and categorize him, so that he&#x2019;s a little bit suspicious of the whole interview and media process. And if you come to him with a lot of nervousness, you can almost freeze as an interviewer. You really want to ask certain questions and your focus is on that. But Dylan will often reject those questions. And you have to step back and say, Okay, what does he want to talk about, and then let him find a comfort zone or a topic he&#x2019;s happy with, and then keep going down that path. But as an interviewer you have to make that kind of transition. There&#x2019;s a generosity and straightforwardness about him, and a hidden intelligence that you don&#x2019;t often notice when you&#x2019;re talking to him. You have to get back to the tape and listen to it when the interview is done to discover it because your nervousness has hidden it from you when you were speaking to him.<br> <br>&#x201c;He once told me that from his point of view the hard thing was that people often asked him questions he hadn&#x2019;t ever thought about and wanted an answer right then. And he didn&#x2019;t want to give a shallow reply, so sometimes he&#x2019;d be hesitant or pause, and if he saw that there was no way to do it, he&#x2019;d just want to move on to something else. A lot of times interviewers try to keep him on that question, and that&#x2019;s why he sometimes starts playing games just to try to get past that.<br> <br>&#x201c;He also once told me that he doesn&#x2019;t like interviews because he often didn&#x2019;t know what he should say until he was driving away. So I mentioned to him that he could call me at the paper the next day if he thought of something. And so he did call&#x2014;it was a Saturday&#x2014;and he had a couple of things he had written down, like Johnny Carson jokes, and one of them was: &#x2018;The country is so confused these days they don&#x2019;t know whether to follow the president or the Green Bay Packers.&#x2019; So he&#x2019;d thought about those lines and called back to say them for my article.<br> <br>&#x201c;If he can talk about things he feels comfortable about, you don&#x2019;t need to pull or prod him, he&#x2019;ll just start talking. You simply have to relax and let him take the reins a bit. The Don&#x2019;t Look Back thing really does hang over him, but that&#x2019;s not the way he always is. Sometimes you just want to give him a hug when he does feel comfortable and starts talking in a meaningful way. And I really treasure those moments and his warmth a lot.&#x201d;<br> <br>Those of us fortunate enough to have been invited to interview Bob Dylan were usually forewarned to expect a hyperequivocal, trickster-like character, someone ineluctably prone to caustic put-ons and put-downs. In fact, he is&#x2014;as most of the interviews in this collection make clear&#x2014;at once obviously reluctant, self-pr...</p><h2>On Epidemics: Spiritual Perspectives</h2><p>Based on brief, pithy quotations from Rudolf Steiner&#x2019;s collected works, the "spiritual perspectives" in this volume present core concepts on the subject of epidemics. These brief extracts do not claim to provide exhaustive treatment of the subject, but open up approaches to the complexity of Steiner&#x2019;s extraordinary world of ideas. Some readers will find these fragments sufficient stimulus in themselves, while others will use the source references as signposts toward deeper study and understanding.</p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.</p><h2>Canoeing with the Cree</h2><p>The eminent journalist began his book-publishing career in 1935 with this exciting account of the adventurous 2,250-mile canoe trip he and a friend made as teenagers from Minneapolis to Hudson Bay.</p><p>Eric Sevareid&#34;Canoeing with the Cree is an all-time favorite of mine.&#34;--Ann Bancroft, Arctic explorer</p><h2>Love and Other Stories (The Tales of Chekhov) (English and Russian Edition)</h2><p>Short stories explore the problems of daily life in Russia during the late 1800s</p><p>Anton Chekhov, in full Anton Pavlovich Chekhov (born Jan. 29 [Jan. 17, Old Style], 1860, Taganrog, Russia&#x2014;died July 14/15 [July 1/2], 1904, Badenweiler, Ger.), major Russian playwright and master of the modern short story. He was a literary artist of laconic precision who probed below the surface of life, laying bare the secret motives of his characters. Chekhov&#x2019;s best plays and short stories lack complex plots and neat solutions. Concentrating on apparent trivialities, they create a special kind of atmosphere, sometimes termed haunting or lyrical. Chekhov described the Russian life of his time using a deceptively simple technique devoid of obtrusive literary devices, and he is regarded as the outstanding representative of the late 19th-century Russian realist school.Text: English, Russian (translation)</p><h2>Loving Well Retreat - Journal</h2><p><p><b>The Loving Well 28-day Journal</b> by <b>Beth Moore</b> can be used either as part of a 4-week study or as follow up for a retreat.

Today, more than 300 years after it was first conceived, Newton's theory of gravitation is still the basic working theory of astronomers and of all the scientists dealing with space exploration and celestial mechanics. However, Newton's theory of gravitation has serious defects: it is incapable of accounting for certain fine details of planetary motion; it does not provide any information on the temporal aspect of gravitational interactions; it cannot be reconciled with the principle of causality and with the law of conservation of momentum. <p>This book extends and generalizes Newton's theory of gravitation, makes it free from the above defects, and provides a large variety of methods for calculating gravitational interactions between moving or stationary bodies of all shapes, sizes and configurations. </p><p>The starting point of the generalization of Newton's theory of gravitation developed in this book is the idea that gravitational interactions are mediated by two force fields: the gravitational field proper created by all masses and acting upon all masses, and the "cogravitational" field created by moving masses only and acting upon moving masses only. In accordance with the principle of causality, the two fields are represented by <i>retarded</i> field integrals, which, for static or slowly-varying gravitational systems, yield the ordinary Newtonian gravitational field. </p><p>An immediate consequence of the generalized Newtonian theory of gravitation developed on this basis is that gravitational interactions normally involve at least five different forces associated with velocities, accelerations and rotations of interacting bodies. The effects of these forces are quite remarkable. Some examples: a fast-moving mass passing a spherically-symmetric body causes the latter to rotate; a mass moving with rapidly-decreasing velocity exerts both an attractive and a repulsive force on neighboring bodies; a rotating mass that is suddenly stopped causes neighboring bodies to rotate; planets orbiting the Sun cause a differential rotation of the Sun. </p><p>The generalized theory of gravitation is fully compatible with the laws of conservation of energy and momentum. A very important result of this compatibility is the definitive explanation of the process of conversion of gravitational field energy into the kinetic energy of bodies moving under the action of gravitational fields. </p><p>The generalized theory of gravitation predicts the existence of gravitation-cogravitational waves and explains how such waves can be generated. </p><p>The generalized theory of gravitation also indicates the existence of antigravitational (repulsive) fields and mass formations. A cosmological consequence of such fields and mass formations is a periodic expansion and contraction of the Universe. Another consequence is that the actual mass of the Universe may be much larger than the mass revealed by an analysis of gravitational attraction in the galaxies. </p><p>It is natural to compare the various consequences of the generalized theory of gravitation with the consequences of the general relativity theory. In this regard the following three remarks should be made. </p><p>First, there are no observable gravitational effects revealed by the general relativity theory that do not have their counterparts in the generalized theory of gravitation. </p><p>Second, the generalized theory of gravitation describes a vastly larger number of gravitational effects than those described by the general relativity theory. </p><p>Third, numerical values for gravitational effects predicted by the general relativity theory are usually different from the corresponding values predicted by the generalized theory of gravitation; the difference is almost always a consequence of greater complexity and depth of gravitational interactions revealed by the generalized theory of gravitation. </p><p>Although this book presents the results of original research, it is written in the style of a textbook and contains numerous illustrative examples demonstrating various applications of the generalized Newtonian theory of gravitation developed in the book.</p>The author is a Professor of Physics at West Virginia University</p><h2>The Littles and the Trash Tinies (The Littles #7)</h2><p>The eighth book from this classic series is ready to grab the attention of a new generation!

The Zemachs have interpreted the folk tale which the play dramatized, recognizable as a version of the widespread Rumpelstiltskin story. Its main themes are familiar, but the character and details of this picture book are entirely Cornish, as robust and distinctive as the higgledy-piggledy, cliff-hanging villages that dot England's southwestern coast from Penzance to Land's End.<br><br>The language spoken by the Christmas players was a rich mixture of local English dialect and Old Cornish (similar to Welsh and Gaelic), and something of this flavor is preserved in Harve Zemach's retelling. Margot Zemach's pen-and-wash illustrations combine a refined sense of comedy with telling observation of character, felicitous drawing with decorative richness, to a degree that surpasses her own past accomplishments.&nbsp;<i>Duffy and the Devil</i> is a 1973 New York Times Book Review Notable Children's Book of the Year and Outstanding Book of the Year, a 1974 National Book Award Finalist for Children's Books, and the winner of the 1974 Caldecott Medal.</p><p><b>Margot Zemach</b> (1931-89) was born in Los Angeles, California. She began illustrating stories by her husband, Harve, in 1959, and their subsequent collaborations led to many enduring children's books, including<i> The Judge: An Untrue Tale, a Caldecott Honor Book; A Penny a Look</i>, an ALA Notable Book; and <i>Duffy and the Devil</i>, recipient of the Caldecott Medal."'The devil can make Squire Lovel's stockings for all I care,' cries Duffy the servant girl in this comical Cornish version of Rumpelstiltskin-and that of course is just what he does, with the well-known proviso that 'at the end of three years I'll take you away-unless you can tell me my name.'"-Pointer, <i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br></p><h2>The Gospel of Luke, Revised Edition: Revised Ed: Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi (Daily Study Bible)</h2><p>In the Gospel of Luke, the great Scottish Bible interpreter William Barclay follows the formula of the Daily Study Bible Series by first giving the text of the day&#39;s study in his own translation, followed by two of three pages of commentary</p><p><b>William Barclay</b> (1907-1978) is known and loved by millions worldwide as one of the greatest Christian teachers of modern times. His insights into the New Testament, combined with his vibrant writing style, have delighted and enlightened readers of all ages for over half a century. He served for most of his life as Professor of Divinity at the University of Glasgow, and wrote more than fifty books--most of which are still in print today. His most popular work, the <i>Daily Study Bible</i>, has been translated into over a dozen languages and has sold more than ten million copies around the world.First and foremost, Luke's gospel is an exceedingly careful bit of work. His Greek is notably good. The first four verses are well-nigh the best Greek in the New Testament. In them he claims that his work is the product of the most careful research. His opportunities were ample and his sources must have been good. As the trusted companion of Paul he must have known all the great figures of the Church, and we may be sure that he had them tell their stories to him. For two years he was Paul's companion in imprisonment in Caesarea. In those long days he had every opportunity for study and research and he must have used them well.<br> An example of Luke's care is the way in which he dates the emergence of John the Baptist. He does so by no fewer than six contemporary datings. 'In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar [1], Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea [2], Herod being tetrarch of Galilee [3], and his brother Philip being tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis [4], and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene [5] in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas [6], the word of God came to John' (Luke 3:1-2, Revised Standard Version). Here is a man who is writing with care and who will be as accurate as it is possible for him to be.<br> <br>A Historian's Care<br> <br>The Gospel of Women<br> In Palestine the place of women was low. In the Jewish morning prayer a man thanks God that he has not made him 'a Gentile, a slave or a woman'. But Luke gives a very special place to women. The birth narrative is told from Mary's point of view. It is in Luke that we read of Elizabeth, of Anna, of the widow at Nain, of the woman who anointed Jesus' feet in the house of Simon the Pharisee. It is Luke who makes vivid the pictures of Martha and Mary and of Mary Magdalene. It is very likely that Luke was a native of Macedonia where women held a more emancipated position than anywhere else; and that may have something to do with it.<br> <br>The Gospel of Praise<br> In Luke the phrase praising God occurs oftener than in all the rest of the New Testament put together. This praise reaches its peak in the three great hymns that the Church has sung throughout all her generations - the Magnificat (1:46-55), the Benedictus (1:68-79) and the Nunc Dimittis (2:29-32). There is a radiance in Luke's gospel which is a lovely thing, as if the sheen of heaven had touched the things of earth.<br> � William Barclay<br></p><h2>The Claw of the Conciliator:Volume Two of the Book of the New Sun</h2><p>1st edition 1st printing paperback, vg++ In stock shipped from our UK warehouse</p><p>No Bio <br> <br>No Bio</p><h2>What to Do When You Don&#39;t Know What to Do</h2><p>An elegant small-format book with a powerful message</p><p>Life is difficult.

The two Babylons seeks to demonstrate a connection between the ancient Babylonian mystery religions and practices of the Roman Catholic Church. Often controversial, yet always engaging, The Two Babylons comes from an era when disciplines such as archaeology and anthropology were in their infancy, and represents an early attempt to synthesize many of the findings of these areas and Biblical truth. The author methodically uses the ancient Chaldean Language and an abundance of Greek, Roman, Egyptian and other authors. Catholicism is just disguised Egyptian and Greek mystery religions by those that were in a dying Roman Empire trying to hold onto power in any way possible. So they created the facade at the Nicene Council in 327 AD called Catholicism. ABOUT THE AUTHOR:- Alexander Hislop (1807-1865) was a Free Church of Scotland minister known for his criticisms of the Roman Catholic Church. He was for a time Parish schoolmaster of Wick, Caithness. In 1831 he married Jane Pearson. He was for a time editor of the Scottish Guardian newspaper. As a probationer he joined the Free Church of Scotland at the disruption 1843. He was ordained in 1844 at the East Free Church, Arbroath, where he became senior minister in 1864. He died of a paralytic stroke, the next year after being ill for about two years.

Morgan, and Harlan Ellison share tips on writing the horror novel</p><p>Oftentimes how-to books fall short because they spend too much time with the basics and not enough time explaining the nuances of their subject. <i>Writing Horror,</i> by the Horror Writers Association, doesn't fall into that trap; the authors of the 39 articles in this anthology assume you can write, and thus they concentrate on getting the most out of working in the horror genre. The result is more like an inspirational guide than a how-to book. Of specific interest is the small section on writing horror comic books, featuring essays on E. C. Comics by Dan Chichester (who has done several Clive Barker adaptations as well as a well-received run on <i>Daredevil</i>), and "Breaking All Codes" by David Quinn (who broke all sorts of taboos in his bloody and sexy <i>Faust</i>). Other authors include Joe R. Lansdale, Joyce Carol Oates, and the one and only Harlan Ellison.A seasoned horror writer and writing teacher pulls together a vast amount of information on the genre. The psychology of writing horror; techniques of dialogue and characterization; the relationship of horror to other forms of literature; submission procedures; career management; horror in electronic, graphic, and other nonprint media--there is something here about all these and more. Some of the essays require a bit of mental translating, but others--notably those of Tina Jens and David Morrell--are models of clarity, content, and wit. Robert Weinberg contributes a basic reading list, and there are tidbits on markets (inevitably soon to become outdated--the fault of fate, not the editor) and even an interview with and a story by Harlan Ellison. No one seriously interested in writing or reading horror will fail to gain something from this straightforward, largely successful how-to. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>Detective Inspector Huss</h2><p>"Add the voice of Helen Tursten to the list of mystery writers who know how to craft a truly satisfying police procedural."&#x2014;<i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> <br><br>"An absorbing, intelligent mystery that holds its own alongside the best feminine hardboiled novels currently being written by Englishwomen Val McDermid and Liza Cody, and our own Sara Paretsky."&#x2014;Maureen Corrigan, NPR, "Fresh Air," <i>Washington Post Book World</i> <br><br>"The picture Tursten provides of Sweden&#x2019;s growing anti-immigrant resentment&#x2014;embodied in Huss&#x2019; skinhead daughter&#x2014;imbues this novel with a cold chill of dread that can&#x2019;t be attributed only to the subfreezing temperatures of G�teborg in winter."&#x2014;<i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> <br><br>Inspector Irene Huss, stationed in G�teborg, is called through the rain-drenched wintry streets to the scene of an apparent suicide.

Even though<br>it was still rush hour, there were few people on the street. The pedestrians<br>huddled beneath umbrellas turned inside out and scrunched their<br>chins into turned-up collars for a little protection from the icy, whipping<br>rain. Everyone who could was driving a car or jammed into the<br>steaming warmth aboard a bus or streetcar.<br><br>An elderly woman pulling a stubborn, soaking-wet dachshund on<br>a leash stood closest. The howls that she and the dog uttered announced<br>to those people in the vicinity that something serious had happened.<br>Hurrying pedestrians slowed their pace. Curiosity got the upper<br>hand, and they were drawn toward the site of the accident.<br><br>A white Mercedes was carelessly parked by the curb. A man in a<br>light-colored overcoat had just rushed around the car and opened the<br>door on the passenger&#x2019;s side when the lady with the dachshund started<br>to scream. The man turned quickly, squinted through the rain, and<br>caught sight of the heap thirty meters away. He kept his grip on the<br>open car door, slowly tilted his head back, and looked up at the top<br>floor of the imposing apartment building. A faint moaning sound rose<br>from his throat, but he remained catatonically still.<br><br>Without putting on her coat, the small woman in the passenger&#x2019;s<br>seat jumped nimbly out of the car and ran over to the motionless figure<br>on the ground. Her slenderness was emphasized by the stylish<br>Chanel dress she was wearing. She had mastered to perfection the art<br>of running in high heels. She elbowed her way through the crowd frenetically<br>and reached the inner circle.<br><br>Chapter One<br><br>THE PATROL CAR WAS the first to arrive on the scene. The ambulance<br>came a scant five minutes later. As far as the ambulance medics<br>could tell, there wasn&#x2019;t much for them to do. The two police officers<br>attempted to hold back the sensation-hungry spectators who suddenly<br>were stoic enough to defy both wind and rain. One of the officers got<br>into the car and called for backup.<br><br>&#x201c;Send the crime scene team to the corner of Aschebergsgatan and<br>Molinsgatan. A guy jumped from the fifth floor.

Case in<br>progress!&#x201d;<br><br>Annoyed, he turned to her and sighed. &#x201c;What is it now?&#x201d;<br><br>The detective inspector&#x2019;s voice revealed a slight hint of titillation<br>when she said, &#x201c;Richard von Knecht jumped off his balcony!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Richard von Knecht! The Richard von Knecht?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. It sounds unbelievable. Was there a stock market crash or<br>something?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hop in the car. Did you get an address?&#x201d;<br><br>THE RAIN was pouring down, and the superintendent had to put his<br>windshield wipers on high to be able to see out. G�teborg was really<br>living up to its nickname of &#x201c;Soaking-borg.&#x201d; The week before there<br>had been total winter chaos with half a meter of snow; the whole city<br>had been paralyzed for several days. The result would undoubtedly be<br>a high birth rate the next August. Now it was a few degrees above freezing<br>with not a snowflake to be seen.<br><br>DETECTIVE INSPECTOR HUSS 3<br><br>Detective Inspector Irene Huss phoned her teenage daughters and<br>told them that she&#x2019;d be late. They were used to it by now, after her many<br>years with the Crime Police. They promised to take the dog for a walk<br>and feed him, and to let their father know. Krister was no doubt used<br>to it, too. As was usual, he would make a good dinner for his daughters.<br>Everything had been organized to run smoothly in the family, even<br>without her help.<br><br>She must have sighed audibly, because Superintendent Andersson<br>turned to her and asked, &#x201c;Is something bothering you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, nothing. It&#x2019;s depressing weather. Depressing, with scattered suicides.<br>Depressing. Depressing!&#x201d;<br><br>The superintendent nodded in agreement and stared gloomily at the<br>black rain being flung against the windshield by the gusty wind. He<br>broke the silence and asked, &#x201c;How could Dispatch be so sure that it<br>was really Richard von Knecht who jumped?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;According to the officer on duty, the wife and son were down on<br>the street. Apparently, it was the son who called the police.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know what floor he fell from?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, but it seems it was high enough.&#x201d;<br><br>They sat in silence for a few minutes. At last the superintendent<br>cleared his throat and asked, &#x201c;Do you know anything about Richard<br>von Knecht?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What most people know. Aristocratic family, and wealthy.<br>Talented businessman, stock market speculator, and one of G�teborg&#x2019;s<br>biggest celebrities. According to Aftonbladet&#x2019;s financial section he&#x2019;s a<br>business genius, but my husband says he&#x2019;s just had incredible luck.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is Krister an expert on business and the stock market now, too?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. Although he does own twenty shares of Trygg Hansa, which<br>he received as a bonus when they reorganized a few years back. He&#x2019;s<br>still the chef at Glady&#x2019;s Corner.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s supposed to be a great place. Very trendy, I hear.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You bet.&#x201d;<br><br>Through the slapping of the windshield wipers they could now see<br>the flashing blue lights of the emergency vehicles. The crime team was<br>there and had blocked off a large area. The site of the body&#x2019;s impact<br>was illuminated by a soft light streaming from the glass in the front<br>entrance of an exclusive menswear store. The door was set into the corner<br>of the building&#x2019;s granite foundation. Superintendent Andersson had<br>a vague memory that there had been a pharmacy on this spot when<br>he was a boy. But he wasn&#x2019;t quite sure, since he had grown up in<br>4 Helene Tursten<br><br>Masthugget, the neighborhood that was torn down during &#x201c;urban<br>renewal&#x201d; in the sixties.<br><br>Above the door the corner extended into an oriel. There was an oriel<br>on the corner of each floor, whose bay windows faced in three directions,<br>except for the top floor, which sported a balcony crowned by a<br>turreted roof. It was from there that Richard von Knecht had plunged<br>to the street. Superintendent Andersson let his glance pass over the<br>remains, but he quickly looked away. Inspector Huss also shuddered<br>when she saw what von Knecht looked like. It was not a pretty way<br>to die, she thought. One of the crime scene team came over to them.<br>&#x201c;The medical examiner will be here any minute.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know which one is coming?&#x201d; asked the superintendent.<br><br>A shrug was the reply. With Inspector Huss in his wake, Superintendent<br>Andersson walked over to the parked patrol car.

Few have caught the real sorrow and inexplicable strength of India, the unaccountable crookedness and sweetness, as well as Mistry." --Pico Iyer, <i>Time<br><br></i>"Those who continue to harp on the decline of the novel . . . ought to consider Rohinton Mistry.

Adopted by Pentecostal parents she was raised to be a missionary. This did and didn&#39;t work out. Discovering early the power of books she left home at 16 to live in a Mini and get on with her education. After graduating from Oxford University she worked for a while in the theatre and published her first novel at 25. Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit is based on her own upbringing but using herself as a fictional character. She scripted the novel into a BAFTA-winning BBC drama. 27 years later she re-visited that material in the bestselling memoir Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal? She has written 10 novels for adults, as well as children&#39;s books, non-fiction and screenplays. She writes regularly for the Guardian. She lives in the Cotswolds in a wood and in Spitalfields, London. She believes that art is for everyone and it is her mission to prove it.When my mother was angry with me, which was often, she said, &#x2018;The Devil led us to the wrong crib.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>The image of Satan taking time off from the Cold War and McCarthyism to visit Manchester in 1960 &#x2013; purpose of visit: to deceive Mrs Winterson &#x2013; has a flamboyant theatricality to it. She was a flamboyant depressive; a woman who kept a revolver in the duster drawer, and the bullets in a tin of Pledge. A woman who stayed up all night baking cakes to avoid sleeping in the same bed as my father. A woman with a prolapse, a thyroid condition, an enlarged heart, an ulcerated leg that never healed, and two sets of false teeth &#x2013; matt for everyday, and a pearlised set for &#x2018;best&#x2019;.<br>&nbsp;<br>I do not know why she didn&#x2019;t/couldn&#x2019;t have children. I know that she adopted me because she wanted a friend (she had none), and because I was like a flare sent out into the world &#x2013; a way of saying that she was here &#x2013; a kind of X Marks the Spot.<br>&nbsp;<br>She hated being a nobody, and like all children, adopted or not, I have had to live out some of her unlived life. We do that for our parents &#x2013; we don&#x2019;t really have any choice.<br>&nbsp;<br>She was alive when my first novel, <i>Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit</i>, was published in 1985. It is semiautobiographical, in that it tells the story of a young girl adopted by Pentecostal parents. The girl is supposed to grow up and be a missionary. Instead she falls in love with a woman. Disaster. The girl leaves home, gets herself to Oxford University, returns home to find her mother has built a broadcast radio and is beaming out the Gospel to the heathen. The mother has a handle &#x2013; she&#x2019;s called &#x2018;Kindly Light&#x2019;.<br>&nbsp;<br>The novel begins: &#x2018;<i>Like most people I lived for a long time with my mother and father. My father liked to watch the wrestling, my mother liked to wrestle.</i>&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>For most of my life I&#x2019;ve been a bare-knuckle fighter. The one who wins is the one who hits the hardest. I was beaten as a child and I learned early never to cry. If I was locked out overnight I sat on the doorstep till the milkman came, drank both pints, left the empty bottles to enrage my mother, and walked to school. We always walked. We had no car and no bus money. For me, the average was five miles a day: two miles for the round trip to school; three miles for the round trip to church.<br>&nbsp;<br>Church was every night except Thursdays.<br>&nbsp;<br>I wrote about some of these things in <i>Oranges</i>, and when it was published, my mother sent me a furious note in her immaculate copperplate handwriting demanding a phone call.<br>&nbsp;<br>We hadn&#x2019;t seen each other for several years. I had left Oxford, was scraping together a life, and had written <i>Oranges </i>young &#x2013; I was twenty-five when it was published.<br>&nbsp;<br>I went to a phone box &#x2013; I had no phone. She went to a phone box &#x2013; she had no phone.<br>&nbsp;<br>I dialled the Accrington code and number as instructed, and there she was &#x2013; who needs Skype? I could see her through her voice, her form solidifying in front of me as she talked.<br>&nbsp;<br>She was a big woman, tallish and weighing around twenty stone. Surgical stockings, flat sandals, a Crimplene dress and a nylon headscarf. She would have done her face powder (keep yourself nice), but not lipstick (fast and loose).<br>&nbsp;<br>She filled the phone box. She was out of scale, larger than life. She was like a fairy story where size is approximate and unstable. She loomed up. She expanded. Only later, much later, too late, did I understand how small she was to herself. The baby nobody picked up. The uncarried child still inside her.<br>&nbsp;<br>But that day she was borne up on the shoulders of her own outrage. She said, &#x2018;It&#x2019;s the first time I&#x2019;ve had to order a book in a false name.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>I tried to explain what I had hoped to do. I am an ambitious writer &#x2013; I don&#x2019;t see the point of being anything; no, not anything at all, if you have no ambition for it. 1985 wasn&#x2019;t the day of the memoir &#x2013; and in any case, I wasn&#x2019;t writing one. I was trying to get away from the received idea that women always write about &#x2018;experience&#x2019; &#x2013; the compass of what they know &#x2013; while men write wide and bold &#x2013; the big canvas, the experiment with form. Henry James did no good when he said that Jane Austen wrote on four inches of ivory &#x2013; i.e. tiny observant minutiae. Much the same was said of Emily Dickinson and Virginia Woolf. Those things made me angry. In any case, why could there not be experience <i>and </i>experiment? Why could there not be the observed and the imagined? Why should a woman be limited by anything or anybody? Why should a woman not be ambitious for literature? Ambitious for herself ?<br>&nbsp;<br>Mrs Winterson was having none of it. She knew full well that writers were sex-crazed bohemians who broke the rules and didn&#x2019;t go out to work. Books had been forbidden in our house &#x2013; I&#x2019;ll explain why later &#x2013; and so for me to have written one, and had it published, and had it win a prize . . . and be standing in a phone box giving her a lecture on literature, a polemic on feminism . . .<br>&nbsp;<br><i>The pips &#x2013; more money in the slot </i>&#x2013; and I&#x2019;m thinking, as her voice goes in and out like the sea, &#x2018;Why aren&#x2019;t you proud of me?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br><i>The pips &#x2013; more money in the slot </i>&#x2013; and I&#x2019;m locked out and sitting on the doorstep again. It&#x2019;s really cold and I&#x2019;ve got a newspaper under my bum and I&#x2019;m huddled in my duffel coat.<br>&nbsp;<br>A woman comes by and I know her. She gives me a bag of chips. She knows what my mother is like.<br>&nbsp;<br>Inside our house the light is on. Dad&#x2019;s on the night shift, so she can go to bed, but she won&#x2019;t sleep. She&#x2019;ll read the Bible all night, and when Dad comes home, he&#x2019;ll let me in, and he&#x2019;ll say nothing, and she&#x2019;ll say nothing, and we&#x2019;ll act like it&#x2019;s normal to leave your kid outside all night, and normal never to sleep with your husband. And normal to have two sets of false teeth, and a revolver in the duster drawer . . .<br>&nbsp;<br>We&#x2019;re still on the phone in our phone boxes. She tells me that my success is from the Devil, keeper of the wrong crib. She confronts me with the fact that I have used my own name in the novel &#x2013; if it is a story, why is the main character called Jeanette?<br>&nbsp;<br>Why?<br>&nbsp;<br>I can&#x2019;t remember a time when I wasn&#x2019;t setting my story against hers. It was my survival from the very beginning. Adopted children are self-invented because we have to be; there is an absence, a void, a question mark at the very beginning of our lives. A crucial part of our story is gone, and violently, like a bomb in the womb.<br>&nbsp;<br>The baby explodes into an unknown world that is only knowable through some kind of a story &#x2013; of course that is how we all live, it&#x2019;s the narrative of our lives, but adoption drops you into the story after it has started. It&#x2019;s like reading a book with the first few pages missing. It&#x2019;s like arriving after curtain up. The feeling that something is missing never, ever leaves you &#x2013; and it can&#x2019;t, and it shouldn&#x2019;t, because something <i>is </i>missing.<br>&nbsp;<br>That isn&#x2019;t of its nature negative. The missing part, the missing past, can be an opening, not a void. It can be an entry as well as an exit. It is the fossil record, the imprint of another life, and although you can never have that life, your fingers trace the space where it might have been, and your fingers learn a kind of Braille.<br>&nbsp;<br>There are markings here, raised like welts. Read them. Read the hurt. Rewrite them. Rewrite the hurt.<br>&nbsp;<br>It&#x2019;s why I am a writer &#x2013; I don&#x2019;t say &#x2018;decided&#x2019; to be, or &#x2018;became&#x2019;. It was not an act of will or even a conscious choice. To avoid the narrow mesh of Mrs Winterson&#x2019;s story I had to be able to tell my own. Part fact part fiction is what life is. And it is always a cover story. I wrote my way out.<br>&nbsp;<br>She said, &#x2018;But it&#x2019;s not true . . .&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>Truth? This was a woman who explained the flashdash of mice activity in the kitchen as ectoplasm.<br>&nbsp;<br>There was a terraced house in Accrington, in Lancashire &#x2013; we called those houses two-up twodown: two rooms downstairs, two rooms upstairs. Three of us lived together in that house for sixteen years. I told my version &#x2013; faithful and invented, accurate and misremembered, shuffled in time. I told myself as hero like any shipwreck story. It was a shipwreck, and me thrown on the coastline of humankind, and finding it not altogether human, and rarely kind.<br>&nbsp;<br>And I suppose that the saddest thing for me, thinking about the cover version that is <i>Oranges</i>, is that I wrote a story I could live with. The other one was too painful. I could not survive it.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>By Word of Mouth: Poems from the Spanish, 1916-1959 (New Directions Paperbook)</h2><p><p><strong>The first collection of translations of Spanish and Latin American poetry by William Carlos Williams, containing many previously unknown poems.</strong></p> William Carlos Williams (1883&#x2013;1963) produced a startling number of translations of both Spanish and Latin American poetry starting during WWI and continuing through the late fifties. Williams grew up in a Spanish-speaking home and sometimes described himself as half-Spanish. His mother was Puerto Rican and his father spoke Spanish fluently. &#x201c;Spanish is not, in the sense to which I refer, a literary language,&#x201d; Williams wrote in his <em>Autobiography</em>. &#x201c;It has a place of its own, an independent place very sympathetic to the New World.&#x201d;<br><br> Williams approached translation as a way not only to present the work of unknown Spanish poets, but also to extend the range and capacity of American poetry, to use language &#x201c;with unlimited freshness.&#x201d; Included in this bilingual edition are beautifully rendered translations of poets well-known &#x2015; Neruda, Paz, and Parra &#x2015; and lesser-known: Rafael Are�valo Marti�nez (from Guatemala), Rafael Beltra�n Logron~o (from Spain), and Eunice Odio (from Costa Rica).</p><p><p>Besides being a practicing physician, <strong>William Carlos Williams</strong> (1883&#x2013;1963) was a poet, short-story writer, novelist, translator, playwright, and essayist whose contribution to the development of modern American poetry grew out of his commitment to recording the "local" experience of Rutherford, New Jersey, and its environs.</p><p><strong>Jonathan Cohen</strong> is the editor and compiler of William Carlos Williams&#x2019; <em>By Word of Mouth: Poems from the Spanish,1916&#x2013;1959&nbsp;</em>and editor and translator of Ernesto Cardenal&#x2019;s <em>Pluriverse: New and Selected Poems</em>, both published recently by New Directions.</p>&#x201c;Jonathan Cohen shows us why translation is crucial to understanding Williams, who approached it as an essential act of poetry. The poet emerges as the first among our modernist writers to see the literary value of translating classical and contemporary verse from both Spain and Latin America. <em>By Word of Mouth</em> makes that clear.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Edith Grossman</strong><br><br>&#x201c;This book will reinforce the sense of Williams as one deeply invested in the language and rhythm of the New World &#x2015; North as well as South.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Paul Mariani, author of <i>William Carlos Williams, A New World Naked</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The great pleasure of By Word of Mouth, Williams&#x2019; translations of poems from the Spanish, which he did throughout his career, is reading Williams as he puts on the language of Quevedo, Hern�ndez, Neruda, and Parra, among many others, including his own mother. He saw translation as a way to practice and learn his craft, and in this he both takes part in an ongoing tradition of poetry and sets himself apart from the Modernists we think of as his peers, except for Ezra Pound. This collection is the first record I know of of an ongoing engagement with the poetry of Williams&#x2019; first language.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Mark Jarman, <em>The Hudson Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A splendid surprise.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Patrick Dunagan, <em>NewPages</em></strong></p><h2>The Storm Sister: Book Two (2) (The Seven Sisters)</h2><p><b>A sweeping and spellbinding love story spanning the warm waters of the Mediterranean to the cold, clear skies of Norway&#x2014;the second in an epic new series of novels by #1 internationally bestselling author Lucinda Riley.</b><br><br>Ally D&#x2019;Apli�se is about to compete in one of the world&#x2019;s most perilous yacht races when she hears the news of her adoptive father&#x2019;s sudden, mysterious death.

The deserted curve of golden beach on the island in front of us glimmered in the sun as it sat nestled in its rocky cove. The crystal-clear turquoise water was making a lazy attempt at forming waves as it hit the sands, foaming elegantly like the froth on a cappuccino.<br> <br>Becalmed, I&#x2019;d thought, like me.<br> <br>We&#x2019;d dropped anchor in the small bay off the tiny Greek island of Macheres at sunset the night before, then waded ashore to the cove carrying two coolers. One was filled with fresh red mullet and sardines that Theo had caught earlier that day, the other with wine and water. I&#x2019;d set down my load on the sand, panting with effort, and Theo had kissed my nose tenderly.<br> <br>&#x201c;We are castaways on our very own desert island,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d announced, spreading his arms wide to gesture at the idyllic setting. &#x201c;Now I&#x2019;m off in search of firewood so we can cook our fish.&#x201d;<br> <br>I&#x2019;d watched him as he turned from me and walked toward the rocks forming a crescent around the cove, heading for the tinder-dry sparse bushes that grew in the crevices. Given he was a world-class sailor, his slight frame belied his strength. Compared to the other men I crewed with in sailing competitions who seemed to be all rippling muscles and Tarzan-like chests, Theo was positively diminutive. One of the first things I&#x2019;d noticed about him was his rather lopsided gait. He&#x2019;d since told me how he&#x2019;d broken his ankle falling out of a tree as a child and how it had never mended properly.<br> <br>&#x201c;I suppose it&#x2019;s another reason why I was always destined for a life on the water. When I&#x2019;m sailing, no one can tell how ridiculous I look walking on land,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d chuckled.<br> <br>We&#x2019;d cooked our fish and later made love under the stars. The following morning was our last aboard together. And just before I&#x2019;d decided I absolutely had to resume contact with the outside world by switching on my mobile, and then subsequently discovered my life had shattered into a million tiny pieces, I&#x2019;d lain there next to him perfectly at peace. And, like a surreal dream, my mind had replayed the miracle of Theo and me, and how we&#x2019;d come to be here in this beautiful place . . .<br> <br><br> <br>I&#x2019;d first set eyes on him a year or so ago at the Heineken Regatta in St. Maarten in the Caribbean. The winning crew was celebrating at the victory dinner and I was intrigued to discover that their skipper was Theo Falys-Kings. He was a celebrity in the sailing world, having steered more crews to victory in offshore races during the past five years than any other captain.<br> <br>&#x201c;He isn&#x2019;t what I imagined at all,&#x201d; I commented under my breath to Rob Bellamy, an old crewmate with whom I&#x2019;d sailed for the Swiss national team. &#x201c;He looks like a geek with those horn-rimmed glasses,&#x201d; I added as I watched him stand up to move across to another table, &#x201c;and he has a very odd walk.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s certainly not your average brawny sailor, admittedly,&#x201d; agreed Rob. &#x201c;But, Al, the guy is a total genius. He has a sixth sense when it comes to the water and there&#x2019;s no one I&#x2019;d trust more as my skipper on stormy seas.&#x201d;<br> <br>I was introduced to Theo briefly by Rob later that evening and I noticed his hazel-flecked green eyes were thoughtful as he shook my hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;So, you&#x2019;re the famous Al D&#x2019;Apli�se.&#x201d;<br> <br>Behind his British accent, his voice was warm and steady. &#x201c;Yes, to the latter part of that statement,&#x201d; I said, embarrassed at the compliment, &#x201c;but I think it&#x2019;s you who&#x2019;s famous.&#x201d; Doing my best not to let my gaze waver under his continued scrutiny, I saw his features soften as he let out a chuckle.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s so funny?&#x201d; I demanded.<br> <br>&#x201c;To be frank, I wasn&#x2019;t expecting you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you mean me?&#x201d;<br> <br>Theo&#x2019;s attention was diverted by a photographer wanting a team photo, so I never did get to hear what it was he meant.<br> <br>After that, I began to notice him across the room at various social events for the regattas we took part in. He had an indefinable vibrancy about him and a soft, easy laugh that, despite his outwardly reserved demeanor, seemed to draw people to his side. If the event was formal, he was usually dressed in chinos and a crumpled linen jacket as a nod to protocol and the race sponsors, but his ancient deck shoes and unruly brown hair always made him look as if he&#x2019;d just stepped off a boat.<br> <br>On those first few occasions, it seemed as if we were dancing around each other. Our eyes met often, but Theo never attempted to continue our first conversation. It was only six weeks ago, when my crew had claimed victory in Antigua and we were celebrating at the Lord Nelson&#x2019;s Ball, which marked the end of race week, when he tapped me on the shoulder.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well done, Al,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; I replied, feeling gratified that our crew had beaten his for a change.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m hearing many good things about you this season, Al. Do you fancy coming to crew for me in the Cyclades Regatta in June?&#x201d;<br> <br>I&#x2019;d already been offered a place on another crew but had yet to accept. Theo saw my hesitation.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re already taken?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Provisionally, yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, here&#x2019;s my card. Have a think about it and let me know by the end of the week. I could really do with someone like you aboard.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; I mentally pushed aside my hesitation. Who on earth turned down the chance to crew for the man currently known as &#x201c;the King of the Seas&#x201d;? &#x201c;By the way,&#x201d; I called out as he began to walk away from me, &#x201c;last time we talked, why did you say you weren&#x2019;t expecting me?&#x201d;<br> <br>He paused, his eyes sweeping briefly over me. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d never met you in person; I&#x2019;d just heard tidbits of conversation about your sailing skills, that&#x2019;s all. And as I said, you aren&#x2019;t what I was expecting. Good night, Al.&#x201d;<br> <br>I mulled over our conversation as I walked back to my room in a little inn by St. John&#x2019;s harbor, letting the night air wash over me and wondering why it was that Theo fascinated me so much. Streetlights bathed the cheerful multicolored house fronts in a warm nocturnal glow, and from a distance, the lazy hum of people in the bars and caf�s drifted toward me. I was oblivious to it all, exhilarated as I was by the race win&#x2014;and by Theo Falys-Kings&#x2019;s offer.<br> <br>As soon as I entered my room, I made a beeline for my laptop and wrote him an e-mail to accept his offer. Before I sent it, I took a shower, then stopped to read it through again, blushing at how eager I sounded. Deciding to save it in my drafts folder and send it in a couple of days, I stretched out on my bed, flexing my arms to relieve the tension and soreness from the race that day.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, Al,&#x201d; I muttered to myself with a smile, &#x201c;that will be an interesting regatta.&#x201d;<br> <br>I sent the e-mail as planned and Theo contacted me immediately, saying how pleased he was I could join his crew. Then just two weeks ago, I&#x2019;d found myself inexplicably nervous as I stepped aboard the race-rigged Hanse 540 yacht in Naxos harbor to begin training for the Cyclades Regatta.<br> <br>The race was not overly demanding as competitive racing went, the entrants comprising a mix of serious sailors and weekend enthusiasts, all buoyed up by the prospect of eight days&#x2019; fabulous sailing between some of the most beautiful islands in the world. And as one of the more experienced crews involved, I knew we were strongly fancied to win.<br> <br>Theo&#x2019;s crews were always notoriously young. My friend Rob Bellamy and I, both thirty, were the &#x201c;senior&#x201d; members of the team in terms of age and experience. I&#x2019;d heard that Theo preferred to recruit talent in the early stages of a sailor&#x2019;s career to prevent bad habits. The rest of the crew of six were in their early twenties: Guy, a burly Englishman; Tim, a laid-back Aussie; and Mick, a half-German, half-Greek sailor who knew the waters of the Aegean like the back of his hand.<br> <br>Although I was eager to work with Theo, I hadn&#x2019;t stepped into it blindly; I&#x2019;d done my best beforehand to gather information on the enigma that was &#x201c;the King of the Seas&#x201d; by looking on the Internet and talking to those who had crewed with him previously.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d heard that he was British and had studied at Oxford, which would account for his clipped accent, but on the Internet, his profile said that he was an American citizen who had captained the Yale varsity sailing team to victory many times. One friend of mine had heard he came from a wealthy family, another that he lived on a boat.<br> <br>&#x201c;Perfectionist,&#x201d; &#x201c;Control freak,&#x201d; &#x201c;Hard to please,&#x201d; &#x201c;Workaholic,&#x201d; &#x201c;Misogynist&#x201d; . . . These were other comments I had gathered, the latter coming from a fellow female sailor who claimed she&#x2019;d been sidelined and mistreated on his crew, which did give me pause for thought. But the overwhelming sentiment was simple:<br> <br>&#x201c;Absolutely the best bloody skipper I have ever worked for.&#x201d;<br> <br>That first day aboard, I began to understand why Theo was afforded so much respect from his peers. I was used to shouty skippers who screamed instructions and abuse at one and all, like bad-tempered chefs in a kitchen. Theo&#x2019;s understated approach was a revelation. He said very little as he put us through our paces, just surveyed us all from a distance. When the day was over, he gathered us together and pinpointed our strengths and weaknesses in his calm, steady voice. I realized he&#x2019;d missed nothing, and his natural air of authority meant we hung on every word he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;And by the way, Guy, no more sneaking a cigarette during a practice under race conditions,&#x201d; he added with a half smile as he dismissed us all.<br> <br>Guy blushed to the roots of his blond hair. &#x201c;That guy must have eyes in the back of his head,&#x201d; he mumbled to me as we trooped off the boat to shower and change for dinner.<br> <br>That first evening, I headed out from our pension with the rest of the crew, feeling happy I&#x2019;d made the decision to join them in the race. We walked along Naxos&#x2019;s harbor front, the ancient stone castle lit up above the village and a jumble of twisting alleys winding down between the whitewashed houses. The restaurants along the front were teeming with sailors and tourists enjoying the fresh seafood and raising endless glasses of ouzo. We found a small family-run establishment in the back streets, with rickety wooden chairs and mismatched plates. The home-cooked food was just what we needed after a long day on the boat, the sea air giving us all a ravenous appetite.<br> <br>My obvious hunger elicited stares from the men as I tucked into the moussaka and generous helpings of rice. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the problem? Have you never seen a woman eat before?&#x201d; I commented sarcastically as I leaned forward to grab another flatbread.<br> <br>Theo contributed to the banter with the occasional dry observation but left immediately after dinner, choosing not to participate in the post-supper bar crawl. I followed him shortly afterward. Over my years as a professional sailor, I&#x2019;d learned that the boys&#x2019; antics after dark were not something I wished to witness.<br> <br>In the next couple of days, under Theo&#x2019;s thoughtful green gaze, we began to pull together and quickly became a smoothly efficient team, and my admiration for his methods grew apace. On our third evening on Naxos, feeling particularly tired from a grueling day under the searing Aegean sun, I was the first to stand up from the dinner table.<br> <br>&#x201c;Right, lads, I&#x2019;m off.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Me too. Night, boys. No hangovers aboard tomorrow, please,&#x201d; Theo said, following me out of the restaurant. &#x201c;Can I join you?&#x201d; he asked as he caught up with me in the street outside.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, of course you can,&#x201d; I agreed, feeling suddenly tense that we were alone together for the first time.<br> <br>We walked back to our pension along the narrow cobbled streets, the moonlight illuminating the little white houses with their blue-painted doors and shutters on either side. I did my best to make conversation, but Theo only contributed the odd &#x201c;yes&#x201d; or &#x201c;no,&#x201d; and his taciturn responses began to irritate me.<br> <br>As we reached the lobby of the pension, he suddenly turned to me. &#x201c;You really are an instinctive seaman, Al. You beat most of your crewmates into a cocked hat. Who taught you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My father,&#x201d; I said, surprised by the compliment. &#x201c;He took me out sailing on Lake Geneva from when I was very small.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah, Geneva. That explains the French accent.&#x201d;<br> <br>I readied myself for the typical &#x201c;say something sexy in French&#x201d; type of comment that I usually got from men at this point, but it didn&#x2019;t come.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, your father must be one hell of a sailor&#x2014;he&#x2019;s done an excellent job on you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; I said, disarmed.<br> <br>&#x201c;How do you find being the only woman aboard? Although I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s not a one-off occurrence for you,&#x201d; he added hastily.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think about it, to be honest.&#x201d;<br> <br>He looked at me perceptively through his horn-rimmed glasses. &#x201c;Really? Well, forgive me for saying so, but I think you do. I feel you sometimes try to overcompensate for it and that&#x2019;s when you make errors. I&#x2019;d suggest you relax more and just be yourself. Anyway, good night.&#x201d; He gave me a brief smile, then mounted the white-tiled stairs to his room.<br> <br>That night, as I lay in the narrow bed, the starched white sheets itched against my skin and my cheeks burned at his criticism. Was it my fault that women were still a relative rarity&#x2014;or, as some of my male crewmates would undoubtedly say, a novelty&#x2014;aboard professional racing boats? And who did Theo Falys-Kings think he was?! Some kind of pop psychologist, going around analyzing people who didn&#x2019;t need to be analyzed?<br> <br>I&#x2019;d always thought I handled the woman-in-a-male-dominated-world thing well and had been able to take friendly jibes and asides about my female status on the chin. I&#x2019;d built myself a wall of inviolability in my career, and two different personas: &#x201c;Ally&#x201d; at home, &#x201c;Al&#x201d; at work. Yes, it was often hard and I&#x2019;d learned to hold my tongue, especially when the comments were of a pointedly sexist nature and alluded to my supposed &#x201c;blond&#x201d; behavior. I&#x2019;d always made a point of warding off such remarks by keeping my red-gold curls scraped back from my face and tied firmly in a ponytail, and by not wearing even a smidgen of makeup to accentuate my eyes or cover up my freckles. And I worked just as hard as any of the men on the boat&#x2014;perhaps, I fumed inwardly, harder.<br> <br>Then, still sleepless with indignation, I remembered my father telling me that much of the irritation people feel at personal observations is usually because there is a grain of truth in them. And as the night hours drew on, I had to concede that Theo was probably right. I wasn&#x2019;t being myself.<br> <br>The following evening, Theo joined me again as I walked back to the pension. For all his lack of physical stature, I found him hugely intimidating and I heard myself stumble over my words. As I struggled to explain my dual personas, he listened quietly before responding.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, my father&#x2014;whose opinion I don&#x2019;t normally rate, to be fair,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;once stated that women would run the world if they only played to their strengths and stopped trying to be men. Maybe that&#x2019;s what you should try to do.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s easy for a man to say, but has your father ever worked in a completely female-dominated environment? And would he &#x2018;be himself&#x2019; if he did?&#x201d; I countered, irritated at being patronized.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good point,&#x201d; Theo agreed. &#x201c;Well, at least it might help a little if I called you &#x2018;Ally.&#x2019; It suits you far better than &#x2018;Al.&#x2019; Would you mind?&#x201d;<br> <br>Before I h...</p><h2>Construction of Social Reality</h2><p>Discusses the questions of how social facts come into being, how stable they are, and how cultural knowledge is constructed</p><p>John Searle is the Slusser Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley.

One side of the last spread asks readers: &#34;Now that you&#39;ve walked through the zoo, can you find...?&#34; and shows cameos for careful observers to spot. The other side challenges perceptive youngsters: &#34;What else can you find?&#34; and asks questions such as &#34;Whose legs are these?&#34; and &#34;Whose lunch is this?&#34; Jay&#39;s distinctive crackle-varnished paintings are light and fun.

Lapham studied at Yale and Cambridge and worked for the <i>San Francisco Examiner</i> and <i>New York Herald Tribune</i> before becoming editor of <i>Harper's</i> magazine in 1971. When his column there won a national magazine award in 1995, it was cited as "an exhilarating point of view in an age of conformity." His books include <i>Money and Class in America</i>, <i>Imperial Masquerade</i>, <i>The Wish for Kings</i>, <i>Hotel America</i>, <i>The Agony of Mammon</i>, and <i>Waiting for the Barbarians</i>. He has hosted two television series for PBS, America's Century and Bookmark, and his writing has appeared in <i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>The National Review</i>, <i>Fortune</i>, <i>Forbes</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, the <i>London Observer</i>, and <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, among other publications.Lapham, editor of <i>Harper's</i>, plays the role of a modern-day Tom Paine, propelling stinging criticisms and scathing indictments at the Bush administration and its supporters for what he claims are their bald-faced deceptions about the justifications for the war in Iraq and for establishing policies&#x2014;especially the USA Patriot Act&#x2014;he sees as aimed at silencing dissent about its policies and the war in Iraq. Lapham argues that the muting of dissenting voices has contributed to the erosion of democracy, because policy disagreements form the heart of a democratic republic. Most disturbing, says Lapham, is the complicity of the media in its support of the steady erosion of individual civil liberties in the name of national security. Lapham also levels forceful criticism at our educational system: "An inept and insolent bureaucracy armed with badly written textbooks instills in the class the attitudes of passivity, compliance, and boredom." This, charges Lapham (<i>30 Satires</i>; <i>Theater of War</i>; etc.), results in schools producing citizens who blindly accept the pronouncements of their leaders. The United States, he points out in a strong historical sketch, has a deep history of quashing dissent when politicians have raised alarms over perceived threats to the well-being of the country, most notably with the Sedition Act of 1798, the Espionage Act of 1917 and, he asserts, the Patriot Act. Lapham's compelling book reminds us that "democracy is an uproar, and if we mean to engage the argument about the course of the American future let us hope that it proves to be loud, disorderly, bitter and fierce." <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

David Blackbourn begins his morality tale in the mid-1700s, with the epic story of Frederick the Great, who attempted&#x2015;by importing the great scientific minds of the West and by harnessing the power of his army&#x2015;to transform the uninhabitable marshlands of his scattered kingdom into a modern state. Chronicling the great engineering projects that reshaped the mighty Rhine, the emergence of an ambitious German navy, and the development of hydroelectric power to fuel Germany's convulsive industrial growth before World War I, Blackbourn goes on to show how Nazi racial policies rested on German ideas of mastery of the natural world. Filled with striking reproductions of paintings, maps, and photographs, this grand work of modern history links culture, politics, and the environment in an exploration of the perils faced by nations that attempt to conquer nature.<br> 70 illustrations</p><p>David Blackbourn is the Coolidge Professor of History at Harvard University. His previous books include Germany in the Long Nineteenth Century and Marpingen: Apparitions of the Virgin Mary. He lives in Lexington, Massachusetts.A modern-day German magically transported back 250 years would barely recognize his own country, says Blackbourn, a professor of history at Harvard. Where today manicured fields, straight canals and windmills dominate, then the landscape was "[d]ark and waterlogged, filled with snaking channels half-hidden by overhanging lianas" and inhabited by mosquitoes, frogs, wild boar and wolves. Blackbourn investigates this remarkable feat of aquaforming as Germans sought to manacle nature by means of mammoth hydrological projects, from building dams to "remaking" the Rhine. The simple act of draining a marsh, Blackbourn points out, can be interpreted in multiple ways. Liberals saw in human mastery of the waters a shining instance of scientific rationalism&#x2014;which could be applied to settling national conflicts. Conservatives thought that reclaiming marshland would provide Frederick the Great's regiments with an unimpeded line of march to the battlefront. The Nazis, too, perceived land reclamation as a duty for a "people without space." More recently, Greens have highlighted the downsides of water engineering (loss of biodiversity, pollution, overconsumption) even as its supporters trumpet its successes (free commerce, the end of malaria, control of flooding). The unique framing of Blackbourn's interpretation of German history and the lavish illustrations make this an engrossing read. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Putting aside the idealized posthumous image of Sidney as polished courtier, romantic lover and Protestant soldier, the author has used original documents to construct the more individual but sometimes less pleasant image of a hot-tempered, difficult young man whose religious and political allegiance was often as much the product of opportunism as conviction. After a brilliant and privileged childhood and education, Sidney, uncomfortable at the court of Elizabeth I, shunned the life of a courtier and preferred to write. He died aged 31 in the Netherlands.</p><p>A spirited, speculative, scholarly account of the brief life (1554-86) of the Elizabethan courtier, soldier, diplomat, author, patron--to some the embodiment of the Renaissance ideal--by Duncan- Jones (English/Oxford). ``It is entirely possible,'' ``in fact, most probable,'' and ``bluntly apparent''--to use some of the author's decisively uncertain terms, that the illustrious Sir Philip Sidney considered himself a failure, his life spent as an ``aspirant administrator'' waiting for preferments, as well as for appropriate and endowed brides who would accept him without a title; even recognition as a writer was delayed until after his death. As close to being a prince as a commoner could get--godson of Elizabeth I, heir to two earls, son of a Knight of the Garter who governed England and Wales, and, in his father's absence, the crucial Royal Cupbearer- -Sidney may have lived in the silliest period in English royal history for a man of talent, breeding, and education to excel at court--which required winning the favor of a capricious, vain, and aging Queen, addressed as a ``Glorious Nymph'' by petitioners who sang to her from hiding places in the trees as she walked in the garden below. Sidney apparently found relief from the pressures and constraints of being a court supplicant by writing, among other works, the sonnet sequence Astrophel and Stella; Arcadia, a pastoral romance that Virginia Woolf considered the origin of English fiction; and A Defense of Poesie, defending the morality of verse as well as his practice of writing in English. Although her style is plodding and her tone oddly antagonistic, Duncan-Jones offers a contemporary, psychological reading of Sidney, depicting a quarrelsome, status-conscious, insecure, and--however gifted--petty individual, intensely private in his passions, preferring the company of bachelor friends and older men to his 16-year-old bride. If not the best, this is certainly the most humanizing of Sidney biographies. (Sixteen pages of b&amp;w illustrations--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Writer of exquisite poetry and pastoral romance, scholar, soldier, courtier: Sidney was the archetypal Renaissance man. Duncan-Jones's literary biography, drawing liberally from his letters, does him justice. The first true biography in about half a century, it liberates him from both the fusty and prissy camps to which lit crit surveys tend to assign him. Major and minor literary and historical figures abound, but Duncan-Jones does not let the reader founder, and discussion of the canon ranges from the necessary (the sonnets) to the arcane (narrative structure in the Arcadia ). This should be the Sidney book for years, and as such it is important to Renaissance studies collections. Highly recommended to academic and large public libraries.<br><i>- Robert E.

The unaffected, straightforward quality of Judd&#x2019;s work demonstrates his strong interest in color, form, material, and space. Wanting to create works that could assume a direct material and physical presence without recourse to grand philosophical statements, Judd eschewed classical ideals of representational sculpture and created works that relied on clear, definite objects. Donald Judd: Cor-ten represents the first-ever focused examination of Judd&#x2019;s works in Cor-ten steel, which he began to produce in earnest in 1989 and would continue to elaborate on until his death in 1994. Cor-ten is an alloy that makes steel more resistant to corrosion, and eliminates the need for paint. With its distinctive red-brown patina, Cor-ten afforded Judd a new medium for exploring the relationship between surface and volume, as well as color and form. Prior to 1989, Judd executed a handful of works in Cor-ten primarily as outdoor commissions or site-specific works. This volume is produced on the occasion of the 2015 exhibition at David Zwirner, New York. Designed in close collaboration with Flavin Judd and Judd Foundation, Donald Judd: Cor-ten sheds new light on a body of work that represents the culmination of three decades of aesthetic output and underscores the mastery and control over material and space that characterizes Judd&#x2019;s practice as a whole.</p><p>With the intention of creating straightforward work that could assume a direct material and physical "presence" without recourse to grand philosophical statements, Donald Judd (1928-1994) eschewed the classical ideals of representational sculpture to create a rigorous visual vocabulary that sought clear and definite objects as its primary mode of articulation. Judd&#x2019;s oeuvre has come to define what has been referred to as Minimal art--a label to which the artist strongly objected on the grounds of its generality.<i>Donald Judd: Cor-ten</i> is an exploration not only of the artist but also of the industrial material itself... ten pages of the book are dedicated to the process of making Cor-ten, accompanied full page close-up photographs that study its color and texture in great detail.

With a drive that comes from nothing but the love for what he does, he breaks through and then wrestles with the vagaries of the music industry, the nature of success and its inevitable consequences. Having recorded an expansive body of work and performed with fellow artists from across the spectrum and across every popular music genre, from rock, pop and dance to country, blues and soul, the one constant throughout has been his unique musical gifts and unmistakable voice.<br><br>But how did a boy from a Welsh coal-mining family attain success across the globe? And how has he survived the twists and turns of fame and fortune to not only stay exciting, but actually become more credible and interesting with age? In this, his first ever autobiography, Tom revisits his past and tells the tale of his journey from wartime Pontypridd to LA and beyond. He reveals the stories behind the ups and downs of his fascinating and remarkable life, from the early heydays to the subsequent fallow years to his later period of artistic renaissance.<br><br>It's the story nobody else knows or understands, told by the man who lived it, and written the only way he knows how: simply and from the heart. Raw, honest, funny and powerful, this is a memoir like no other from one of the world's greatest ever singing talents.<br><br>This is Tom Jones and&nbsp;<i>Over the Top and Back</i>&nbsp;is his story.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of December 2015:</strong> Celebrity memoirs can be hit or miss, with the level of satisfaction often determined by the dishy details the celebrity is willing to spill. Readers of pop singer Tom Jones&#x2019; story might be initially disappointed that the hip-swiveling heartthrob, who was famous for having ladies&#x2019; panties thrown at him in concert, doesn&#x2019;t kiss and tell... much. But this book shines when it pushes beyond Jones&#x2019; star status to reveal the real man behind the microphone. Raw stories about growing up near coal mines in Wales and suffering from tuberculosis, getting his girlfriend (soon wife) pregnant when he was sixteen, his slow rise through local clubs, and his breakout to fame and fortune drive the first half, while Jones&#x2019; search for how to stay relevant to himself and the music world after his commercial peak in the 1970s propels the second half. Whether or not you&#x2019;re a Tom Jones fan, this memoir of a singer&#x2019;s rise from working-class Wales to musical superstardom has more power and magnetism than the typical tell-all. <em>&#x2014;Adrian Liang</em></p><b>Tom Jones </b>was born Thomas Jones Woodward in South Wales to a traditional coal-mining family. He began singing at an early age and landed is first record contract in 1964, winning a Grammy in 1965 for "It's Not Unusual." Knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 2006 for his services to music, his recordings have spanned the spectrum of musical styles over 60 years. He lives with his wife of 58 years, Melinda, in Wales and California. They have one son.</p><h2>The Ongoing Moment</h2><p>In his most recent book, Yoga for People Who Can&#x2019;t Be Bothered to Do It, Geoff Dyer confessed that not only did he not take pictures in the course of his travels but that he does not even own a camera. With characteristic perver-sity&#x2014;and trademark originality&#x2014;Dyer has now come up with an idiosyncratic history of <br>. . . photography. Seeking to identify their signature styles, Dyer looks at the ways in which such canonical figures as Alfred Stieglitz, Paul Strand, Walker Evans, Andr� Kert�sz, Edward Weston, Dorothea Lange, Diane Arbus, and William Eggleston, among others, have photographed the same things (barber shops, benches, hands, roads, and signs, for example). In doing so, he constructs a narrative in which these photographers&#x2014;many of whom never met&#x2014;constantly encounter one another.<br><br>Great photographs change the way we see the world; The Ongoing Moment changes the way we look at both. It is the most ambitious example to date of a form of writing that Dyer has made his own: the nonfiction work of art.</p><p>Geoff Dyer is the author of three novels, a critical study of John Berger, and four genre-defying books, including But Beautiful, which was awarded the Somerset Maugham Prize, and Out of Sheer Rage, which was a National Book Critics Circle finalist. He lives in London.I am not the first researcher to draw inspiration from a &#x2018;certain Chinese encyclopaedia&#x2019; described by Borges. According to this arcane work &#x2018;animals are divided into: (a) those that belong to the Emperor; (b) embalmed ones; (c) those that are trained; (d) suckling pigs; (e) mermaids; (f) fabulous ones; (g) stray dogs; (h) those that are included in this classification; (i) those that tremble as if they were mad; (j) innumerable ones; (k) those drawn with a very fine camel&#x2019;s-hair brush; (l) et cetera; (m) those that have just broken the flower vase; (n) those that at distance resemble flies.&#x2019;<br><br>While the survey of photography undertaken in these pages can claim neither this degree of rigour nor eccentricity, it takes heart from earlier, well-intended attempts to marshal the infinite variety of photographic possibilities into some kind of haphazard order. Walker Evans said it was &#x2018;a pet subject&#x2019; of his &#x2013; how writers like James Joyce and Henry James were &#x2018;unconscious photographers&#x2019;. In the case of Walt Whitman there was nothing unconscious about it. &#x2018;In these Leaves [of Grass] every thing is literally photographed,&#x2019; he insisted. &#x2018;Nothing is poeticized.&#x2019; Keen to emulate the &#x2018;Priests of the Sun&#x2019;, Whitman created poems that, at times, read like extended captions in a huge, constantly evolving catalogue of photographs:<br>See, in my poems, cities, solid, vast, inland, with paved streets, with iron and stone edifices, ceaseless vehicles, and commerce,<br><br>See, the many-cylinder&#x2019;d steam-printing-press &#x2013; see, the electric telegraph stretching across the continent, [. . .]<br><br>See, the strong and quick locomotive as it departs, panting, blowing the steam-whistle,<br><br>See ploughmen ploughing farms &#x2013; see, miners digging mines &#x2013; see, the numberless factories,<br><br>See mechanics busy at their benches with tools [. . .]<br>For his part Evans, in 1934, compiled a list of picture categories as a way of clarifying his own ideas about what he was trying to do in his work:<br>People, all classes, surrounded by bunches of the new down-and-out.<br><br>Automobiles and the automobile landscape.<br><br>Architecture, American urban taste, commerce, small scale, large scale, clubs, the city atmosphere, the street smell, the hateful stuff, women&#x2019;s clubs, fake culture, bad education, religion in decay.<br><br>The movies.<br><br>Evidence of what people of the city read, eat, see for amusement, do for relaxation and not get it.<br><br>Sex.<br><br>Advertising.<br><br>A lot else, you see what I mean.<br>The cultural historian Alan Trachtenberg has pointed out that this list calls to mind Lewis Hine&#x2019;s earlier Catalogue of Social and Industrial Photographs, &#x2018;only seasoned with Evans&#x2019;s irony&#x2019;. But it&#x2019;s more than irony that sets the two endeavours apart. Hine&#x2019;s is an entirely logical and rigorous listing &#x2013; &#x2018;Immigrants&#x2019;, &#x2018;Women Workers at Work&#x2019;, &#x2018;Men Workers at Work&#x2019;, &#x2018;Incidents of a Worker&#x2019;s Life&#x2019; and so on &#x2013; comprising over a hundred topics and more than eight hundred sub-topics.* A model of orderly arrangement and organization, it is entirely lacking in the provisional, highly contingent and ultimately unsustainable (&#x2018;a lot else&#x2019;) quality of Evans&#x2019;s catalogue of his own intentions.<br><br>Some of Evans&#x2019;s best-known work was done under the auspices of the Farm Security Administration between 1935&#x2013;37. Known first as the Resettlement Administration, this was one of Roosevelt&#x2019;s New Deal agencies aimed at improving the lot of poor farmers and sharecroppers brought to the brink of starvation by the Depression. The FSA was headed by the economist Rexford Tugwell who, in 1935, appointed his old teaching assistant Roy Stryker to run the Historical Section. Both men were convinced of the power of photographs to give a human reality to economic arguments but it was not until the fall of that year, when Stryker was granted sole responsibility for making a photographic record of the agency&#x2019;s policy and work, that he got a clearer sense of his task &#x2013; and of his power. This was brought into still sharper focus when he saw some photographs that had already been commissioned. They&#x2019;d been done by Evans and were sufficiently impressive to secure the photographer the post as Stryker&#x2019;s Senior Information Specialist. Evans viewed this appointment as a kind of &#x2018;subsidized freedom&#x2019;, but, like many of the other photographers working for Stryker (Ben Shahn, Dorothea Lange, Russell Lee, Arthur Rothstein, among others), he found his freedom compromised by the patron who had bestowed it. As Stryker&#x2019;s sense of his mission grew he issued more and more exacting &#x2018;shooting scripts&#x2019;, broken down by season, often sub-divided by location, itemizing in extraordinary detail what he wanted photographing. Here is an excerpt from a script for &#x2018;Summer&#x2019;:<br>Crowded cars going out on the open road. Gas station attendant filling tank of open touring and convertible cars.<br><br>Rock gardens: sun parasols; beach umbrellas; sandy shores with gently swelling waves; whitecaps showering spray over sailboat in distant horizon.<br><br>People standing in shade of trees and awnings. Open windows on street cars and buses; drinking water from spring or old well; shady spot along bank &#x2013; sun on water beyond; swimming in pools, rivers, and creeks.<br>Under &#x2018;American Habit&#x2019;, photographers of &#x2018;Small Town&#x2019; life were instructed to look out for: &#x2018;R.R. station &#x2013; watching the train &#x201c;go through&#x201d;; sitting on the front porch; women visiting from porch to street; cutting the lawn; watering the lawn; eating ice-cream cones; waiting for the bus . . .&#x2019; In the &#x2018;City&#x2019; they were pointed towards &#x2018;park bench-sitting; waiting for street car; walking the dog; women with youngsters in park or sidewalk; kids&#x2019; games . . .&#x2019; All of this was to be supplemented by &#x2018;General&#x2019; shots: &#x2018;&#x2018;&#x2018;fill &#x2019;er up&#x201d; &#x2013; gas in car; &#x201c;flats fixed&#x201d;; traffic jam; detour sign; &#x201c;Men Working&#x201d; . . . Orange drink. Bill posters; sign painters &#x2013; crowd watching a window sign being painted. Sky writing . . . Parade watching: ticker tape; sitting on curb . . .&#x2019;<br><br>There is a particular poetry &#x2013; the poetry of comprehensive contingency &#x2013; about these scripts, and the fact that they now read as captions shows how diligently, if begrudgingly, Stryker&#x2019;s photographers did his bidding. Stryker supplemented his scripts with still more precise orders to make good any omissions. &#x2018;Where are the elm-shaded streets?&#x2019; he asked Russell Lee, in Amarillo, Texas, in 1939. On another occasion Lee was asked to look out for &#x2018;a small town barber shop where they still have the individual [shaving cream] cups with Mr Citizen&#x2019;s name on each cup&#x2019;. Having told Arthur Rothstein, in Denver, to look out for &#x2018;Raking and burning leaves. Clearing up the garden. Getting ready for winter&#x2019;, Stryker added, as an afterthought: &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t forget people on front porches either.&#x2019; While fulfilling Stryker&#x2019;s orders photographers such as Evans and Lange brought their own private agendas to bear so that, at times, the resulting pictures represent a hybrid or merging of distinct categorical requirements.<br><br>In the 1950s Evans became friendly with the young Swiss photographer Robert Frank whom he encouraged to apply for a Guggenheim fellowship. In support of his application Frank came up with his own, highly individualized list of things he might photograph:<br>a town at night, a parking lot, a supermarket, a highway, the man who owns three cars and the man who owns none, the farmer and his children, a new house and a warped clapboard house, the dictation of taste, the dream of grandeur, advertising, neon lights, the faces of the leaders, and the faces of the followers, gas tanks and post offices and backyards . . .<br>When the fellowship was awarded in 1955 Frank set out on a road trip across America, in the course of which he exposed nearly seven hundred rolls of film. After printing three hundred negatives Frank arranged the pictures into categories such as &#x2018;symbols, cars, cities, people, signs, cemeteries . . .&#x2019; By the time the resulting book, The Americans, was published (in France in 1958; in the States the following year) only traces of this preliminary order could be seen. There were still pictures of cars and cemeteries but the book was no longer arranged around the intended categories.<br><br>In the full knowledge that there are other, more sensible ways to organize a book I take my cue from these highly contingent, provisional, often abandoned attempts rather than the methodical approach of Hine. As Robert Frank put it in his Guggenheim application, &#x2018;the project I have in mind is one that will shape itself as it proceeds, and is essentially elastic.&#x2019; Dorothea Lange also believed that &#x2018;to know ahead of time what you&#x2019;re looking for means you&#x2019;re then only photographing your own preconceptions, which is very limiting.&#x2019; As far as she was concerned it was fine for a photographer to work &#x2018;completely without plan&#x2019; and just photograph &#x2018;that to which he instinctively responds&#x2019;. Taking Lange at her word I tried as far as possible to be open to anything, &#x2018;like a piece of unexposed, sensitized material&#x2019;. Certain pictures caught my eye, just as certain things happened to catch the eye of the photographers who took them in the first place. Initially chance played a key part in both processes. After a point, though, I began to see that a number of these photos had something in common &#x2013; a hat, say &#x2013; and once I became aware of this I started to look out for pictures of h...</p><h2>The Gospel in Parable: Metaphor, Narrative, and Theology in the Synoptic Gospels</h2><p>Professor Donahue here argues that &#34;the parables of Jesus&#34; offer a Gospel in miniature, while at the same time giving shape, direction, and meaning to the Gospels in which they appear. &#34;To study the parables of the Gospels is to study the gospel in parable.&#34; After surveying recent discussions of parable, metaphor, and narrative, Donahue examines and interprets the parables of Mark, Matthew, and Luke as texts in the context of the theology of each of these Gospels. Finally, he outlines what &#34;The Gospel in Parable&#34; looks like and offers suggestions for the proclamation of parables today.</p><p>&#39;Among the many fine books on the New Testament parables in recent years, Donahue&#39;s work stands out for its concentration on the meaning of the parables in their Gospel contexts. His clear and orderly interpretations are based on a thorough mastery of contemporary scholarship.

Her loose, evocative 1950s style, a synthesis of Gorky, de Kooning and Pollock, gave way to '60s color-field experiments a la Mark Rothko, followed by witty, complex, ambivalent metaphors of the '70s and explorations in ceramic tile, steel or clay sculpture, and works on paper.

In the twenty years since, she has written 89 more novels and become the third largest selling female author in the world, with 300 million copies of her books sold in 19 languages in 98 countries. Her most recent bestsellers, Masquerade, Rivals, and Heiress, have all sold more than one million copies each. She is known for her strong, decisive characters, her extraordinary ability to re-create a time and place, and her unerring courage to confront important, controversial issues, like alcoholism and sexual abuse, in her stories.<p>All of her novels are meticulously researched, an endeavor she shares with her husband, Bill Dailey. The couple met in 1963, when Janet worked as a secretary for the construction company Bill owned. The two travel extensively to scout story locations, and have visited all 50 states; these days, they are likely to fly, but miss the time when they drove cross country, a trailer attached to their car. Janet Dailey also reads voraciously about every aspect of any subject she writes about; as she remarks, "Accuracy is important in genre fiction; you have to get it right, zero in on the real details. That's the way to make writing come alive and not irritate the readers with carelessness."</p><p>When they are not traveling, the couple spend time at their home on the shore of Lake Taneycomo in Branson, Missouri. It is the part of the country Dailey loves best, partly because, she says, "The people around me are more interested in their problems and their lives, and that sort of keeps me in touch with reality. They think it's nice that I write, but they really couldn't care less."</p><p>Allison Janney has been featured on Broadway (Present Laughter), in films (Big Night and First Wives Club) and on television shows on all four networks.</p>While the rest of the rural Texas community cringes cravenly in fear, a handsome, virile stranger, aided by a codger and his spirited daughter, challenges the absolute power of the unscrupulous rich rancher and his brawny, randy son. An entry in the bestselling author's Calder family saga, this Western skimps on character depth and freshness, and lards on clich�s of style and (we use the term loosely) substance. Anna Fields contributes excellent diction and accurate phrasing but seems eager to get the assignment over with. Sounding a bit more nasal than usual, she doesn't quite "phone it in" but frequently sounds unengaged with the text.

They held fast to their anger and bitterness through generations.<br><br>Finally one of their sons, Arkov of Garia, seized the throne through treachery and by force of arms, claiming it as rightfully his. But in his haste to see the king and queen slain, Arkov failed to confirm the death of the young prince, Reyer, who was spirited away to safety.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>On a distant and mysterious island ruled by Elves, where he was raised and trained by a trusted Captain of the slain High King, Reyer has now come of age and learned of his lineage. With those loyal to the bloodline of the true High King rallied to his side, Reyer will lead an army against the Usurper&#x2014;to gain back the crown and kingdom stolen from him and to restore Mithgar to its rightful rule.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Dennis L. McKiernan </b>is the author of many novels, most of them set in the world of Mithgar, including <i>City of Jade</i>, <i>Voyage of the Fox Rider</i>, and <i>Dragondoom</i>.

I can hear them at the main door.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going as fast as I can, Ramo. This blasted lead has turned to steel.&#x201d;</p><p>The distant dull thump of the battering ram against the great bronze portal thudded through the deep stone in counterpoint to the steel-on-steel ping of Jamie&#x2019;s hammer against the chisel as it peeled metal from the seam.</p><p>&#x201c;You think they got away?&#x201d; asked Ramo.</p><p>Not pausing in his task, Jamie replied, &#x201c;We can only hope.&#x201d;</p><p>Behind the two, a lad&#x2014;a court page&#x2014;wept but said naught as he held one of the two lanterns on high.</p><p>Ramo held the other lantern for Jamie to see the lead-sealed joint. &#x201c;Lor! Lor! I can no believe it, the Queen bein&#x2019; dead and the King hisself not long to live, him with the arrow lodged in his gut.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He might&#x201d;&#x2014;Ping!&#x2014;&#x201c;already&#x201d;&#x2014;Ping!&#x2014;&#x201c;be gone,&#x201d; said Jamie, while far above the ram crashed against the door.</p><p>With a clatter, Jamie dropped his hammer and chisel. &#x201c;There! I think we got it! Help me with this.&#x201d;</p><p>Ramo set the lantern down and, grunting, he and Jamie shoved against the heavy granite cover.</p><p>The page behind stepped forward and held his own lantern aloft for them to see by.</p><p>And with stone grinding against stone, the lid gave way, and they pivoted it aside.</p><p>&#x201c;There he is,&#x201d; said Ramo.</p><p>Jamie reached in and lifted the bundle out. He turned and gave it to the youth. &#x201c;Now, fly, lad, fly, else all is lost.&#x201d;</p><p>Lantern in hand, bundle in arm, the youngster darted away and up the twisting stairs.</p><p>&#x201c;Back to work,&#x201d; said Jamie, and he and Ramo shoved the heavy stone lid into place. Then Jamie retrieved his hammer, while Ramo took up a mallet of his own.</p><p>Even as they began their task, the boy raced up the stony flight, his breath coming in gasps. Zigging this way and zagging that, among the many confusing turns and levels he sped, the bundle faintly clattering as he ran. At last the boy burst onto the main floor of the castle and dashed toward the throne room. Behind him servants slammed the doors shut.</p><p>And still the great ram&#x2014;Boom! . . . Boom!&#x2014;smashed against the main bronze portal, demanding entry.</p><p>As the page scurried into the Chamber of State and passed among the few survivors of the King&#x2019;s guard, he broke out in tears anew, for the slain Queen lay upon a mass of wood set for a great pyre, and the King, sword yet in hand, sagged against the bier on which rested the oiled timber. The monarch was pierced through by an arrow up to its feathers, the long shaft entering just below his rib cage and angling down to thrust out from his back. Streaming blood steadily flowed along the outjutting length to fall from the wicked steel point.</p><p>Boom!&#x2014;the bronze door juddered and mortar dust fell.</p><p>&#x201c;Quickly,&#x201d; whispered the King, gesturing upward toward the Queen in her deathly repose.</p><p>The lad set his lantern to the floor and scrambled up and gently lay the bundle in the arms of the slain Lady, and then he jumped back down.</p><p>&#x201c;My lord, I don&#x2019;t think I can&#x2014;&#x201d; began the boy, but the King interrupted him and said, &#x201c;I will do it. Light the torch.&#x201d;</p><p>Boom! . . . Boom!</p><p>The page took up the stave from the pedestal and set the oil-wrap-cloth ablaze, and then handed the fiery brand to the sovereign.</p><p>&#x201c;Now run, boy, run!&#x201d; commanded the King.</p><p>But the lad fell to his knees in grief.</p><p>Boom! . . .</p><p>. . . And a block of lintel stone crashed down.</p><p>The King hobbled about the bier, thrusting the flame into the pyre.</p><p>The blaze hungrily leapt upward, the tinder-dry, resinous wood eagerly clutching the fire unto itself.</p><p>Boom! One of the mighty hinges gave way.</p><p>Shouts of victory sounded.</p><p>Boom! The other hinge gave way, and . . .</p><p>. . . with a thunderous Blang! the door fell inward and onto the stone of the throne chamber.</p><p>Arrows flew, and the first to die was the boy.</p><p>Next were slain the remnants of the King&#x2019;s guard.</p><p>The King raised his gore-slathered sword to meet the onrushing foe, but before they reached him the King fell dead, as the through-piercing arrow took its final toll.</p><p>Yawling bloodthirsty cries, the Garian soldiers hurtled within and raced throughout the castle, and none of the servants survived.</p><p>Moments later, the new High King of Mithgar strode into the fiery chamber, where the dethroned King lay dead and his slain Queen and her bundle burned.</p><p>While far down in the catacombs within the tall spire of Caer Pendwyr, Jamie and Ramo tapped the lead back in place to seal the sarcophagus once more.</p><p>And even farther below in the night, a small boat put out to sea, its own cargo precious beyond compare.</p><br><p>[insert map 3]</p><p>2</p><p>Ocean and Seas</p><p>The High King&#x2019;s realm is bordered by water on three sides: to the south lie the warm, indigo waters of the deep blue Avagon Sea. From the Islands of Stone in the northeast to the tangle of the Isle of Kistan in the southwest it spans. Rich farming and grazing lands lie upon the Avagon&#x2019;s northern coast, and wealthy but desert lands upon its southern shores.</p><p>This wide sea debouches through the rover-infested, perilous Straits of Kistan, beyond which lies the vast Weston Ocean. The Weston itself is hazardous, too, but not because of pirates. The ocean has a measure of rovers as well as storms, but they are not the primary danger; rather the immensity of this vastness requires navigators of considerable skill, and so most of the commerce hugs the shores.</p><p>The High King&#x2019;s realm is bordered on the west not only by this great water, but also by the storm-driven Northern Sea, whose cold and violent black waters are perilous enough to discourage all but the most daring or desperate.</p><p>The Boreal Sea lies on the north of the High King&#x2019;s lands, and its waters are frigid beyond imagining. It is from these waters that the Fjordlanders come in their Dragonships to raid and plunder their enemies of old. But among the principal dangers of the Boreal are the Great Maelstrom there at the end of the Gronfang Mountains and the Krakens living therein, as well as the Dragons who roost above this deadly vortex.</p><p>These four waters that embrace the High King&#x2019;s domain on three sides are perilous . . . but each for a different reason. Yet the High King has his residence along the shores of one. . . .</p><p>. . . And in that residence . . .</p><p>High above, on the tall stone spire atop which sat Caer Pendwyr, the new High King and his Garian soldiers celebrated the demise of the old. At the behest of their sire, the revelers cut off the former King&#x2019;s head and mounted it on a pike outjutting from the battlements, so that it looked down at its arrow-pierced headless corpse dangling by grume-slathered ropes just above the gate, with its elbows splayed outward as of a broken scarecrow waiting for the dawn when the ravens would come for their due.</p><p>And in the high-vaulted Chamber of State the victorious soldiers cavorted about the smoldering remains of the funeral pyre containing the ashes of Queen and child. The new High King himself lolled upon the seized throne and drank bloodred wine and smiled at the antics of his men. He was filled with glorious power and exultant satisfaction, for he was certain the former King&#x2019;s misbegotten bloodline had been extinguished entirely, thus avenging an old and festering injustice at last.</p><p>But far below and as silent as a midnight shadow, the small craft with its precious cargo glided southeasterly out upon the starlit waters of the deep blue Avagon Sea, the ocean now gone ebon in the moonless night, but for the glitter from above. With her dark sails set to make the most of the breeze, southeasterly she fled, and at the hands of her master she deftly slipped past the Albaner carrack on patrol.</p><p>The ship sailed a sea-league or so before turning west-southwesterly, and in the spangled night a whispering zephyr filled her silken sails to gently carry her across the calm waters. And she was another seven sea leagues along this course ere the waning moon, naught but a thin crescent, rose in the east.</p><p>Soon the sun would follow.</p><p>As the silvery glimmer of dawn light delicately painted the oncoming morning skies, the boat was some eight leagues away, well beyond the lax attention of carousing Albaner lookouts abaft. And even were they to spot her, most likely it was naught but a small fishing craft out for the early catch.</p><p>Vanidar Silverleaf at the tiller gazed at the last visible gleamings above and bade the stars farewell, even though, as it is with all Elves, he knew where they stood no matter the mark of day or season. Given his immortal breed, Silverleaf appeared to be no more than a lean-limbed youth, though his actual age could have been one millennium or ten or more. He had golden hair cropped at the shoulder and tied back with a simple leather headband, as was the fashion among many of Elvenkind. Under his dark cloak he was clad in grey-green and wore a golden belt that held a long-knife. His feet were shod in soft leather and he stood perhaps five foot nine or ten. At his side lay a silver-handled horn-limbed bow and a quiver of arrows fletched green. And as he sat in the dawning, he made a small change to the tiller, and adjusted the sheets to make the most of the quickening wind, now blowing out from the land of Pellar to strike the starboard beam.</p><p>As the day drew upon the world and the sun illuminated the clear waters of the sea, &#x201c;I deem it safe now to come above,&#x201d; he called.</p><p>From the tiny cabin below a female answered, a tremor in her gentle voice. &#x201c;Soon, Lord Vanidar. I am feeding Reyer, now.&#x201d;</p><p>Silverleaf nodded to himself, and, tying the tiller, he took up a lantern and replaced the glass with a bracket, then he lit the flame beneath. He set a small copper teapot upon the tiny improvised stove and added fresh water. Soon he infused the steaming liquid with a few generous pinches of tea and set it aside to steep.</p><p>Up and out from the small quarters below, a slender, young, dark-haired woman clad in men&#x2019;s garments emerged. Her face was drawn and gaunt&#x2014;from fear and grief and lack of sleep&#x2014;and her dark blue eyes were shot with red from weeping.</p><p>Saying naught a word, Silverleaf handed her a cup of the warm tisane.</p><p>Gratefully, she took it, clutching it in both hands. After a sip, she said, &#x201c;They&#x2019;re both sleeping: Reyer and my own Alric.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We are going to have to give Reyer a different name, Lady Gretta.&#x201d;</p><p>The Jordian woman looked into Silverleaf&#x2019;s pale grey gaze. &#x201c;My Lord Vanidar, why would we&#x2014;? Oh. I see.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just so, my lady,&#x201d; said Silverleaf.</p><p>&#x201c;Where are we taking him, Lord Vanidar?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;By order of the High King, to Kell.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The westernmost isle of Gelen? The one not on any map?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Aye. It seems shipmasters and their navigators are reluctant to put it on any map, for it was a time hidden by a remote ring of mist, though once on the isle, no mist wafted in the distance upon the sea, either near or far. Whether it be Mage- or god-made, one might think that strange, neh? And fearing to displease Magekind or mayhap Garlon, god of the sea, ocean pilots and captains did not record its position, and they still hew to that tradition, even though only natural mists now and then hide the isle. Aye, even to this day no map marks its place, yet all sailors of any worth ken where the island lies, so its location is not a great secret, yet once it was and to some still is. Regardless, strange or not, superstitions be damned, &#x2019;tis to Kell we go.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then we should call him something that fits the Kellian tongue.&#x201d;</p><p>Silverleaf nodded. &#x201c;We should.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know any Kellian names,&#x201d; said Gretta.</p><p>Silverleaf burst out in laughter. &#x201c;Neither do I.&#x201d;</p><p>They stopped twice in small seaside villages along the way to pick up supplies and fresh water and to gain respite from the small craft, but always they sailed onward, heading for Arbalin Isle. Altogether a fortnight passed ere in a driving rain they rode the braw breeze and a flowing dusk tide into safe harbor to take anchorage at Port Arbalin.</p><p>Sheltering the pair of two-year-olds from the downpour, Silverleaf led Gretta to a modest inn&#x2014;the Gull&#x2014;and that night they slept soundly for the first time in days. The next morn, Silverleaf went to the harbormaster and arranged for passage to Kell. &#x201c;With warship escorts through the Straits of Kistan, mind you, to ward off the Rovers lurking there.&#x201d;</p><p>Upon his return to the Gull, bearing needed provender and goods he tapped upon Lady Gretta&#x2019;s door. As they unloaded the wares, he said, &#x201c;I stopped at the Red Slipper and had a drink with an old friend, and I now have a Kellian name for Reyer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; asked Gretta, stowing the commodities while keeping an eye upon the two wee lads&#x2014;Reyer fair-haired, Alric dark-. Both children, free at last from tight ship&#x2019;s quarters, happily toddled about the chamber to now and again stop and examine something, all the while babbling away in a language they both seemed to understand.</p><p>&#x201c;R�g�n. We will call him R�g�n, a fitting name.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Has it a meaning?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Aye. Little King.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Won&#x2019;t that be telling?&#x201d;</p><p>Silverleaf shook his head. &#x201c;Aravan says many a Kellian lad is named R�g�n.&#x201d;</p><p>Three months later, as he had been instructed by the now dead High King, Silverleaf bearing R�g�n, and Gretta holding Alric, rode from a small seaside village on the western shores of Kell and to a cattle-and-pig farm carved out of the forest in the green-clad rolling hills beyond. They met with a widower named Conal&#x2014;forty or so&#x2014;who had been a captain in the King&#x2019;s Guard some ten years past.</p><p>When Silverleaf rode away the next day&#x2014;with Gretta&#x2019;s mount on a lead following after&#x2014;he left Gretta and R�g�n and Alric behind in the loyal care of a soldier, a farmer, a drover, a King&#x2019;s man.</p><p>Moreover, that the forest surround also harbored Dylvana was of no small import in the plan.</p></p><h2>Mortal stakes (The best mysteries of all time)</h2><p>Everybody loves a winner, and the Rabbs are major league.

Nothing could have prepared him for the crisis that would soon rock the agency to its foundation, as a burgeoning environmental movement challenged the Forest Service&#x2019;s legacy and legitimacy.<br><br> The Forest Service stumbled in responding to a wave of lawsuits from environmental groups in the late 20th Century&#x2014;a phenomenon best symbolized by the spotted owl controversy that shut down logging on public forests in the Pacific Northwest in the 1990s. The agency was brought to its knees, pitted between a powerful timber industry that had been having its way with the national forests for decades, and organized environmentalists who believed public lands had been abused and deserved better stewardship.<br><br><i>Toward a Natural Forest</i> offers an insider&#x2019;s view of this tumultuous time in the history of the Forest Service, presenting twin tales of transformation, both within the agency and within the author&#x2019;s evolving environmental consciousness. While stewarding our national forests with the best of intentions, had the Forest Service diminished their natural essence and ecological values? How could one man confront the crisis while remaining loyal to his employer?<br><br> In this revealing memoir, Furnish addresses the fundamental human drive to gain sustenance from and protect the Earth, believing that we need not destroy it in the process. Drawing on the author&#x2019;s personal experience and his broad professional knowledge, <i>Toward a Natural Forest</i> illuminates the potential of the Forest Service to provide strong leadership in global conservation efforts. Those interested in our public lands&#x2014;environmentalists, natural resource professionals, academics, and historians&#x2014;will find Jim Furnish&#x2019;s story deeply informed, thought-provoking, and ultimately inspiring.</p><p>Jim Furnish is a consulting forester in the Washington D.C. area following a 34-year career with the USDA Forest Service. He served as the agency&#x2019;s Deputy Chief and Siuslaw National Forest Supervisor in Corvallis, Oregon. Furnish was a principle Forest Service leader in creating the Roadless Area Conservation Rule (2001), as well as in reforming management of the Siuslaw National Forest from timber production to restoration principles. He has served on the board of directors of several environmental and faith-based non-profit organizations.</p><h2>Troubled Waters: An Alan Lewrie Naval Adventure (Alan Lewrie Naval Adventures)</h2><p><p>The fourteenth tale in Dewey Lambdin&#x2019;s classic naval adventure series </p><p>Spring of 1800, and Captain Alan Lewrie, fresh from victory in the South Atlantic, is reckoned a hero on a par with Nelson in all the papers. Back in England, he&#x2019;s fitting out his new frigate, HMS <i>Savage, </i>the fruits of that victory, the largest and best-armed frigate he&#x2019;s ever commanded. But you can&#x2019;t leave Lewrie ashore too long without trouble arising.</p><p>A Jamaica court has tried him <i>in absentia </i>and sentenced him to hang for the theft of a dozen Black slaves to man his old ship, HMS <i>Proteus</i>. A crime, or was it liberation, as his London barrister argues? The vengeful slaveowner, Hugh Beauman, has come to London to seek Lewrie&#x2019;s end . . . with or without the majesty of the Law!</p><p>Then there&#x2019;s the matter of those anonymous letters sent to his wife, Caroline, portraying him as a faithless rakehell and serving up the most florid lies . . . along with some unfortunately florid truths. Lewrie appeals to the &#x201c;retired&#x201d; Foreign Office spy, Zachariah Twigg, to &#x201c;smoak out&#x201d; the hand that guides the poison pen, even while wondering why Twigg seems so eager to help his legal case, of a sudden. Is the devious old devil ready to sacrifice him for some motive of his own?</p><p>A fortunate legal ruling, which only delays the matter of Lewrie&#x2019;s utter ruin, leaves him free to take <i>Savage </i>to sea upon the King&#x2019;s business, to join the close blockade of the Gironde River in Sou&#x2019;west France, and plug the threat of enemy warships, privateers, and &nbsp;neutrals smuggling goods in and out of Bordeaux. It <i>could </i>be a dull and plodding dreariness, but . . . a <i>bored </i>Captain Alan Lewrie, safe in his post for the moment, can be a <i>dangerous </i>fellow to his country&#x2019;s foes. If only to relieve the tedium!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Dewey Lambdin is the author of thirteen previous Alan Lewrie novels and an omnibus volume, <i>For King and Country</i>. A member of the U.S. Naval Institute and a Friend of the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England, Lambdin has been a sailor since 1976, and he spends his free time working and sailing. He makes his home in Nashville, Tennessee, but would much prefer Margaritaville or Murrell&#x2019;s Inlet.</p>Chapter 1<br>Captain Alan Lewrie, RN, stepped out of the doors of the George Inn, just as the watch bells of a myriad of warships and merchant vessels in Portsmouth Harbour began to chime the end of the Morning Watch&#x2014;Eight Bells, and the start of the Forenoon&#x2014;in a distant, jangly ting-tinging much like what a rider near London might hear from church bells of a Sunday morning.<br>Not exactly a sound to set one&#x2019;s pocket-watch by, that chiming, for each ship depended on the turning of sand-glasses to measure hours and half hours, quarter hours for the Dog Watches, the initial turning of the glasses dependent on the vagaries of masters&#x2019; and captains&#x2019; time pieces, all of varying quality, accuracy, and cost.<br>Lewrie unconsciously drew his watch from a waist-coat pocket and found the time to be two and a half minutes past 8 a.m. Then he, as half a dozen other officers nearby did, put it to his ear to see if it was still ticking strongly. One much older Post-Captain growled under his breath, gave his a hard shake, and damned its maker with a muttered &#x201c;Christ . . . bloody cogs!&#x201d; before stalking off.<br>Lewrie merely shrugged, put his back in his waist-coat pocket, and lifted his gaze to savour the morning. And a fine morning it was, by Jove! There was ample early summer sunshine, and the sky was barely dappled with thinly scattered and quick-scudding light clouds. Flags and vanes showed the wind had come about from the Nor&#x2019;east, and in some strength, too, for the flies of those flags were snapping chearly, the halliards chattering against the flagpoles. Weather vanes on rooves squeaked and jiggled to a relatively brisk breeze.<br>Lewrie resettled his cocked hat on his head, and, now alone on the walkway as the other officers headed away on their own occasions, allowed himself a most satisfying belch&#x2014;not a well-stifled, gentlemanly thing, but a rather long, and loud, eructation; for in all of Portsmouth there was no breakfast finer than that served at the George Inn, and his morning repast of two eggs fried not quite to hard, with fried and grated potatoes, a chop-sized hank of flank beef, and bread sliced two finger-joints thick, toasted to perfection, then slathered with fresh butter and Kentish apple preserves, had been perfection . . . and, sluiced down with three cups of coffee fetched to his table half-scalding, to boot . . . well!<br>That belch, in point of fact, was so savoury that Lewrie allowed himself a second before taking hold of the scabbard of his hundred-guinea presentation small-sword to restrict its swinging, and set off towards the quays, and the King&#x2019;s Stairs, where he would take a hired boat back to his new frigate.<br>The morning was so clear and bright that even before he got to the King&#x2019;s Stairs, Lewrie could espy dozens of sail making the most of the shift of wind to head down-Channel for the Atlantic. Nearer to, at least a dozen warships were falling down to St. Helen&#x2019;s Patch, down to the Isle of Wight and the open sea, after being cooped up in port for a fortnight or more, awaiting a favourable slant of wind and a moderation in the weather.<br>To be back at sea! Were Savage in any respects ready to sail, what a grand morning&#x2019;s departure it would be, but, alas, his frigate still lay to anchor with both bowers and both stern kedges down, with her upper masts and rigging stripped &#x201c;to a gant-line&#x201d; for re-rigging and re-masting to his satisfaction. Her jib-boom and bowsprit had been steeved to a lower angle, whole new sets of inner and outer jibs cut and sewn, and the Sailmaker and his crew ready to make new fore-and-aft stays&#x2019;ls to Lewrie&#x2019;s requirements, once the upper masts were set in place . . . all to aid HMS Savage to &#x201c;point&#x201d; just a half, or a quarter, point closer to the eyes of the winds.<br>The sooner, the better, pray Jesus! Lewrie fretfully thought, his good mood and joy of a good breakfast curdled by the dread that he might not stay free long enough to skitter over the horizon, out of reach of his pending legal troubles . . . and the adamantine wrath of the Beauman family.<br>No wonder the others were peerin&#x2019; at me so odd, Lewrie thought as he reached the stone quays; wond&#x2019;rin&#x2019; whether I&#x2019;m saint or felon.<br>The George Inn was one of the better establishments in Portsmouth, the favourite of senior naval officers, so he had been among an host of Rear-Admirals, a Commodore or three, and Post-Captains of more than Three Years&#x2019; Seniority, like himself, &#x201c;salted enough&#x201d; to wear a pair of gilt-lace epaulets on their shoulders. They&#x2019;d seemed polite and civil enough, some smiling as they pointed him out to their table companions and gave him a nod. Others, well . . . <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Lewrie, don&#x2019;t ye know . . . pile o&#x2019; &#x2019;tin&#x2019; in the West Indies . . . the &#x2018;Ram-Cat,&#x2019; he&#x2019;s called, and God pity his poor wife . . . at Cape Saint Vincent and Camperdown, both, with the medals for &#x2019;em . . . a fight near Cape Town in early spring, took a bigger French frigate . . . two-hour fight in a blowin&#x2019; gale, I heard . . . got his frigate out from the Nore during the Mutiny . . . oh, in all the papers, and such &#x2019;cause he stole Jamaican slaves t&#x2019;crew his ship . . . darlin&#x2019; of the Abolition crowd, and Wilberforce, so please ye! &#x2018;Black Alan&#x2019; Lewrie now, haw-haw . . . soon t&#x2019;hang, I heard, God rot &#x2019;im! Aye, and Wilberforce, too . . . demned &#x2018;reformers&#x2019; and &#x2018;kill-joys&#x2019;!&#x201d;<br>Lewrie had heard rumours from his new allies in the Society for the Abolition of Slavery in the British Empire, the Reverend William Wilberforce and his coterie, that the Beauman family, already about as fond of him as cold, boiled mutton, had departed Jamaica for England.<br>Now they&#x2019;d finally discovered just who it was who stole their dozen prime field hands from one of their many plantations, the one on the shore of Portland Bight (well, sort of, kind of, recruited or received, not stolen exactly!), they were come with vengeance running hot in their spleens to see him tried, convicted, stripped of all of his wealth and property, cashiered from the Royal Navy, then most publicly and satisfyingly carted to Tyburn and hung from a gibbet, to the taunts from the Mob, and the Huzzahs of the Beaumans.<br>Never should&#x2019;ve shot their damned cousin in that duel, Lewrie silently rued, grimly recalling when he&#x2019;d seconded his old friend Kit Cashman, who&#x2019;d drilled the youngest Beauman brother, Ledyard, right in the belly, too, who&#x2019;d taken five agonising days to die after they had scandalously violated the rules of honour with a back-shot, and extra, hidden pistols. Though it was satisfyin&#x2019; . . . <br>Most of the bumboats and boats for hire were scurrying about from vessel to vessel, and for the moment, only two remained tied to the landing, their shabby bundled or furled sails rustling and snapping to the breeze, and frayed rope halliards chattering against their short masts, the blocks clattering and squealing. Lewrie paused from choosing, taking a long look seaward. It was such a clear and sunny day that he could even see far up-channel into the main anchorage of Spithead, past Gilkicker Point into the little-used and shallow channel of Needles Passage round the west end of the Isle of Wight. Redcoats standing sentry-go on the ramparts of the Monckton Fort could be spotted individually. To the east, he could even make out the heights of Selsey Bill, for a rare wonder.<br>And there was his brand-new frigate, HMS Savage, anchored not five cables offshore, and as shiny as a new-minted penny, just fresh from the graving docks. Her new hull paint, tar, and pitch shone in the morning light, every glitter of sunshine on the cat&#x2019;s-pawed harbour waters reflected down her sleek flanks like a continual shower of diamond chips. She floated light and high, less her guns and stores, which still sat ashore in warehouses and armouries at Gun Wharf, or among the goods from the Victualling Board&#x2019;s vast depot, and fresh copper cladding, normally below the waterline, flickered with dapples of sun like a horizontal sheet of gold or brass.<br>She was a Fifth Rate 18-pounder of over 950 tons burthen, the largest, longest, best-armed ship Lewrie had ever been appointed to command, and the thought of losing captaincy over her was as painful as the dread of dying. She was long, lean, and powerful-looking with such a sweet, aggressive curve to her sheerline and gunwale, with an entry and forefoot finer and leaner than the usual bluff bowed ships built in British yards. She was a leashed greyhound! A French greyhound, Lewrie had to remind himself; even so, though . . . <br>The French had built her at Brest, of stout Hamburg oak before the outbreak of the war in 1792, and commissioned in the vicious and bloody turmoil of the Terror in &#x2019;93, named in honour of the crackpot ideas of the philosopher Rousseau as Le Sauvage Noble. Sent out to an ignoble sacrifice, Lewrie had learned, for with all the former aristocratic or Royalist-leaning officers of the French Navy dismissed from the service, hunted down for trial and humiliation by the revolutionaries, imprisoned for a time were they lucky . . . their heads chopped off by the heavy, wicked blade of the guillotine were they not . . . she had been captained, and her semi-hapless crew led, by former Bosun&#x2019;s Mates and matelots with the &#x201c;proper&#x201d; revolutionary attitudes and viewpoints. When she ran afoul of a lighter-gunned British frigate off Rochefort a year later, in &#x2019;94, all her grace and power had gone for nought and she had abjectly surrendered after a mere quarter-hour&#x2019;s pounding!<br>Re-named HMS Savage, taking the name of a much older Sixth Rate of 16 guns that had gone to the breakers after serving since 1761, she&#x2019;d been &#x201c;bought in&#x201d; and commissioned into the Royal Navy for a full three years of active service before requiring a &#x201c;truck to keel&#x201d; refit, a new crew, and a new captain, and Lewrie had thought himself as fortunate to get her, but . . . <br>&#x201c;Hoy there, fellow!&#x201d; someone cried nearby. &#x201c;A boat, at once, I say!&#x201d; Lewrie turned away from admiring his frigate to espy an officer, a Lieutenant in best-dress uniform, trotting along the quay, chivvying a much older, gap-toothed and one-eyed civilian in charge of a broken-down hand-cart piled with the officer&#x2019;s dunnage, the Lieutenant lending a hand on one of the shafts to speed the hand-cart along. Lewrie noted the typical sea-chest, much battered and scraped, with its original gay and martial paint nearly faded away; a large canvas sea-bag, and a pair of stuffed-to-bursting portmanteaus made of scrap carpet, to boot, atop the precarious and wobbly cart.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m late, I&#x2019;m late!&#x201d; the younger officer could be heard to say. &#x201c;Christ, a quarter past Eight Bells! I&#x2019;m fucked, so bloody fucked . . . oh!&#x201d; he exclaimed as he took note of Lewrie and his pair of epaulets. He visibly blanched, almost slammed to a stop in chagrin to use blasphemy and Billingsate in the presence of a Post-Captain.<br>&#x201c;Joining a ship, are you?&#x201d; Lewrie enquired, putting a &#x201c;stern&#x201d; expression on his phyz. &#x201c;Cuttin&#x2019; it rather fine, ain&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Aye, sir,&#x201d; the Lieutenant replied, doffing his cocked hat in salute, to which Lewrie replied with two fingers touching the brim of his own. &#x201c;Got the last coach, skin o&#x2019; me teeth, that, and arrived at a late hour last night, sir. Some old friends at the Blue Posts . . .&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Indeed,&#x201d; Lewrie primly drawled, quite enjoying himself, for a rare once lately. Damme, this is fun! he thought. &#x201c;And they simply had to &#x2018;wet you down&#x2019; to your new posting, hmm?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Aye, sir,&#x201d; the Lieutenant shamefacedly replied.<br>&#x201c;A damned bad beginning, sir,&#x201d; Lewrie admonished. To punctuate his shammed disdain for such, he drew out his pocket-watch and peered at its face, then turned and waved at the last remaining hired boat at the foot of the landing, for, during their brief conversation, another Lieutenant and two Midshipmen had engaged the other, better boat.<br>&#x201c;I, ah . . . ,&#x201d; the Lieutenant began to say, realising that he was going to be even later reporting aboard his new ship, for he was out-ranked and would have to wait for the return of anything that floated.<br>&#x201c;I s&#x2019;pose I could offer you a ride, Mister, ah . . . ?&#x201d; Lewrie idly offered.<br>&#x201c;Urquhart, sir. Ed&#x2019;ard Urquhart,&#x201d; the other told him, looking desperately into the middle distance to see if anything resembling a hired boat was coming back to the foot of the King&#x2019;s Stairs empty. &#x201c;Edward, mean t&#x2019;say . . . ,&#x201d; he babbled on. &#x201c;Might I enquire as to where your ship is anchored, sir? Mine own is quite near at hand . . . that frigate just yonder, sir . . . Savage.&#x201d;<br>Aha! Lewrie exultantly thought; they&#x2019;ve finally got round to sendin&#x2019; me a First Officer, at last! One had turned up, weeks before, but that&#x2019;un had pleaded off sick after the first week, and had departed looking like Death&#x2019;s Head On A Mop-Stick, hacking, wheezing, coughing, and hoicking up phlegm by the bucket. He&#x2019;s mine, damn his eyes!<br>&#x201c;What? Captain Alan Lewrie&#x2019;s ship?&#x201d; Lewrie pretended to scoff.<br>&#x201c;Aye, sir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Under that scoundrel, that rogue?&#x201d; Lewrie mock-sneered. &#x201c;That rakehell Corinthian? Hah! God have mercy on your soul, then, sir!&#x201d;<br>Lt. Edward (or Ed&#x2019;ard) Urquhart blushed and gulped, timorously replying, &#x201c;I was given to understand, though, sir, that Captain Lewrie is a most distinguished and capable captain. A renowned . . .&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Any fool can be brave and dashin&#x2019;, don&#x2019;t ye know, sir,&#x201d; Lewrie pooh-poohed. &#x201c;Well, then, Mister Urquhart. I will, this once, mind, take mercy &#x2019;pon ye, and allow you to board that shiny wee barge, before attending to mine own urgent return to my ship. Bargee! Two passengers . . . and all this . . . jetsam.&#x201d;&nbsp;Copyright � 2007 by Dewey Lambdin.

Hall was for twenty years director of writing programs at the University of California, Irvine. He is also director of the Squaw Valley Writing Program and in 1998 received a PEN Center USA West Award of Honor for lifetime literary achievement.After their Hawaiian escapades in Ambrose Bierce and the Death of Kings (2001), the irascible author of The Devil's Dictionary (fitting definitions from which head each chapter) and his Boswell, Tom Redmond, find murder and hanky-panky aplenty back home in California. At the behest of millionaire publisher Willie Hearst, the pair investigates two murders-that of a photographer in Hearst's employ and that of a randy British yachtsman (known as a "one-eyed jack")-as well as the theft of some intimate photos of Hearst's gorgeous mistress. Redmond's attentions are divided between the chase and his latest love, Eliza Lindley, directress of the Stockton Street Mission and savior of Chinese girls from evil slavers. Unsurprisingly, a connection between the murders and the slavers soon emerges. Like Bierce, Hall is fond of coincidences, some of which strain credulity, but few readers will mind amid all the driving action, including midnight revels in Sausalito and white-water chases across San Francisco Bay. Also like Bierce, who delivers a gem of a lecture on good writing in chapter two, Hall has become a master of succinct description ("Miss Lindley... smelled of soap"; "Stone rearranged his graceful slouch"). The fate of Willie Hearst, women's honor and Tom Redmond's fragile heart hang in the balance, and Hall keeps all pots boiling and in concert right to the end.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Preaching: How to Preach Biblically (The John MacArthur Pastors&#39; Library)</h2><p>364 pp. &#34;How To Preach Biblically presents in one volume the essentials of biblical preaching.

And of course, the artists &#x2014; Bellini, Titian, Tintoretto, Tiepolo, with their passion for colour and form. There are wars and sieges, scandals and seductions, fountains playing in deserted squares and crowds thronging the markets. And there is a dark undertone too, of shadowy corners and dead ends, prisons and punishment.<br><br>We could have no better guide to Venice than Peter Ackroyd whose book is, itself, a glorious journey and the perfect holiday.</p><p>Peter Ackroyd is an award-winning novelist as well as biographer, poet and historian.

They came in flat-bottomed boats, moving over the shallows. They were exiles, far from their own cities or farms, fleeing from the marauding tribes of the North and the East. And they had come to this wild place, a wide and flat lagoon in which fresh water from the rivers on the mainland and salt water from the Adriatic mingled. At low tide there were mud-flats all around, cut through with streams and rivulets and small channels; at high tide there were small islands of silt and marsh-grass. There were shoals covered with reeds and wild grasses, rising just a little way above the waters. There were patches of land that were generally submerged but, at certain low tides, rose above the water. There were desolate marshes that the water only rarely covered. The salt marshes and the shore seemed from a distance to make up the same wide expanse, marked with ponds and islets. There were swamps here, too, as dark and uninviting as the waters that the tide did not reach. A line of islands, made up of sand and river debris, helped to protect the lagoon from the sea; these were covered with pine woods.<br><br>Although the lagoon was not far from the once great centres of Roman civilisation, it was remote and secluded. This was a solitary place, its silence broken only by the calls of the seabirds and the crash of the billows of the sea and the sound of the wind soughing in the rushes. At night it was the setting of a vast darkness, except in those patches where the moon illumined the restless waters. Yet in the daylight of the exiles' approach the silver sea stretched out into a line of mist, and the cloudy sky seemed to reflect the silvery motions of the water. They were drawn into a womb of light. They found an island. And a voice, like the sound of many waters, told them to build a church on the ground they had found. This is one of the stories of origin that the Venetians told.<br><br>The lagoon itself is an ambiguous area that is neither land nor sea. It is approximately thirty-five miles (56 km) in length and seven miles (11 km) in width, taking a crescent shape along part of the coast of north-eastern Italy. It was created some six thousand years ago, emerging from the mud and silt and debris that came down into the Adriatic from seven rivers. The principal among them--the rivers Brenta, Sile and Piave--carried material from the Alps and the Apennines; a city of stone would one day rise on the minute debris of mountains. The swamps and marshes and mud-flats are protected from the sea by a long and narrow bank of sand, divided into islands by several channels; the longest of those islands is now known as the Lido. The channels make openings in the barrier, entrances known as porti, through which the sea rushes into the lagoon. There are now three such porti at the Lido, at Malamocco and at Chioggia. These tides breathe life into Venice.<br><br>It is a continually various and unsettled scene, part mud and part sand and part clay; it is changed by tides, always shifting and unstable. There is a current in the Adriatic that flows up and down from the Mediterranean, and each of the porti creates its own distinct basin or force of water. That is why the appearance of the lagoon has altered over the centuries. There is one theory that, as late as the sixth and seventh centuries, the lagoon was essentially a marsh covered by water at high tide. In the nineteenth century, according to John Ruskin, there were times at low tide when it seemed that Venice was marooned on a vast plain of dark green seaweed. The whole lagoon in fact would have become dry land five hundred years ago, were it not for the intervention of the Venetians themselves. The lagoon is now simply another part of Venice, another quarter that happens to be neither land nor sea. But it is slowly returning to the sea. The waters are growing deeper, and more salty. It is a precarious place. Saint Christopher, carrying the infant Christ across the water, was once a popular saint of the city.<br><br>There have always been inhabitants of the lagoon. The wilderness could, after all, be fruitful. From the earliest times there were small pockets of people--fishermen and fowlers ready to take advantage of the abundance of wildfowl and marine life as well as the autumnal migration of the fish from the rivers to the sea. The marshes are also a natural place for the harvesting of salt. Salt was a valuable commodity. The Venetians were always known as a mercantile people, but the first stirrings of trade in this area began even before their ancestors had arrived.<br><br>The earliest tribes are lost in the darkness of prehistory. But the first recognisable ancestors of the Venetians inhabited the region surrounding the lagoon from the eighth century bc. These were the people who dwelled in the north-eastern part of Italy as well as along the coasts of what are now Slovenia and Croatia. They were known as the Veneti or the Venetkens; Homer refers to them as the "Enetoi," because there is no "v" sound in classical Greek. They were primarily merchants, as the Venetians would become, trading in amber and wax, honey and cheese. They set up great markets, like those which the Venetians eventually established. They traded with Greece, just as Venice would one day trade with Byzantium and the East. They specialised in the extraction of salt from coastal areas, in a way that anticipates the Venetian monopoly of salt production.<br><br>They dressed in black, which became the colour characteristically worn by patrician Venetian males. Hercules was the tribal hero of the Veneti, and became a legendary protector of Venice; he is the demi-god who acquires by labour what others claim by right. The Veneti traced their descent from Antenor, who led them from the ruined city of Troy. They were well known for their skill in seamanship, and were essentially a maritime people. They submitted, in marital and familial matters, to the authority of the state. These were the people who inhabited cities such as Padua and Altino, Aquileia and Grado. These were the exiles who came for safety to the waters of the lagoon.<br><br>Before the time of flight, the Veneti were thoroughly Romanised. By the second century ad they had made a pact with the powers of Rome. In the reign of Augustus the area of the lagoon was part of the Tenth District of Italy and then in the fourth century it became part of the eastern Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire. The lagoon was already partly settled. On one of the islands, S. Francesco del Deserto, have been found the remains of a Roman port with pottery from the first century and wall plaster of the third century.<br><br>The port was no doubt used by those vessels sailing between Aquileia and Ravenna, bearing grain from Pannonia as well as goods and supplies from more distant shores. Amphorae have been discovered here, for the carriage of wine and olive oil that had come from the eastern Mediterranean. The larger ships would dock on the island, their goods then transported to smaller ships for the shallows of the lagoon. There must have been local pilots, therefore, to guide the craft through these exiguous waters. A walkway, dating to the second century ad, has been found beneath the nave of the basilica of S. Maria Assunta on the island of Torcello. Roman remains have been found at a great depth on the island of S. Giorgio Maggiore, and material from the first and second centuries has been discovered on smaller islands. Other finds, on other islands, can be dated from the fourth to the seventh centuries. It has been suggested that the outer islands of the lagoon could have been used as a station for the Roman fleet; it is conceivable, to say no more, that villas were constructed here.<br><br>Yet there was a fundamental change in the nature of the lagoon when the exiles from the mainland began to arrive in larger and larger numbers. There was no central exodus, but rather successive waves of migration that culminated in the late sixth century. The Veneti were escaping from invaders. In 403 Alaric the Visigoth descended upon the province of Venetia; in the words of Claudian, the historian of Rome, "fame proclaimed the march of the barbarian, and filled the land with terror." Aquileia and Verona fell, with many of their inhabitants fleeing to the safety of the islands. When the threat of Alaric had passed, some returned home. But others stayed, making a new life in the lagoon. In 446 Attila gained Roman provinces from the Danube to the Balkans and then, six years later, took Aquileia; Altino and Padua were also sacked. Once more the refugees from these disasters fled to the lagoon.<br><br>There was a pattern to their movement. The people of Altino migrated to Torcello and Burano, for example, while those from Treviso went to Rialto and Malamocco. The inhabitants of Padua sailed to Chioggia. The citizens of Aquileia moved to Grado, which was itself protected by marshes. They came with craftsmen and builders, with farmers and labourers, with patricians and plebeians; they came with the sacred vessels from their churches, and even with the stones of their public buildings so that they might build anew. But how could they build on such shifting ground? How could they build upon mud and water? It was possible, however, for wooden poles of from ten to a dozen feet in length to be sunk into the mud before reaching a layer of harder clay and dense sand that acted as a firm foundation. This was the "boundary" at the bottom of the lagoon. So there sprang up small houses known as casoni made from the wood of poles and boards, with pitched roofs of wattle and reed.<br><br>New towns, such as Heraclea and Equilio (Jesolo), were founded by the edge of the lagoon. On the islands were established village communities, with leaders consulting assemblies of the people. The Veneti may also have set up fortified encampments, in the event that the Huns or Goths decided to move against them. But the islanders were fractious and competitive; there was no unity in the lagoons. So in 466, just twenty years after the appearance of Attila, a meeting of all the Veneti of the lagoon was held at Grado. It was decided that each island would be represented by a tribune, and that the tribunes would then work together for the common good. They were, after all, facing the same dangers and difficulties--not least from the depredations of the sea. This was the first sign of the public and communal spirit that would one day manifest itself so clearly in Venice itself.<br><br>The Veneti were by the sixth century a defined presence in the region. They were paid to ferry people and goods between the ports and harbours of the mainland. They transported the soldiers of Byzantium from Grado to the river Brenta. They carried officials and merchants to Byzantium itself. Already they were known for their maritime skills. Their boats travelled up the rivers of northern Italy, trading salt and fish to the cities and villages en route.<br><br>The first description of these island people comes in a letter sent in 523 to their tribunes by a legate from the Ostrogoth kingdom then prevailing in northern Italy. Cassiodorus was asking them to transport wine and oil across the waters to Ravenna. "For you live like seabirds," he wrote, "with your homes dispersed, like the Cyclades, across the surface of the water. The solidity of the earth on which they rest is secured only by osier and wattle; yet you do not hesitate to oppose so frail a bulwark to the wildness of the sea." He was not quite accurate in his description; there were already some houses constructed from the stone and brick of the mainland. He went on to say that the Veneti "have one great wealth--the fish which suffices for you all. Among you there is no difference between rich and poor; your food is the same, your houses are all alike." Again, this was not quite true. Extant testimonials suggest that, even at an early stage in the development of the lagoon, there were rich as well as poor families. Cassiodorus then added that "your energies are spent on your salt fields; in them indeed lies your prosperity." In this, at least, he was right. And he added the significant detail of "your boats--which like horses you keep tied up at the doors of your dwellings." By good fortune one of these boats has emerged from the mud of the lagoon. Part of a rib of oak, and a hull of lime, have been found on the island of S. Francesco del Deserto; the boat itself dates to the fifth century. It was lying at a level that, in this period, would have been submerged except at times of low tide.<br><br>Yet Venice itself was not yet born. It is not shown in a fourth-century map of the region, in which the lagoon is depicted as a sea route without people. Venetian historians claimed, however, that the city was established at midday on 25 March 421, by a poor fisherman known as Giovanni Bono or John the Good. There are advantages to this theory, since the same date has been given to the vernal equinox, the Annunciation and the supposed date of the foundation of Rome. The triple coincidence, as well as the provident arrival of John the Good, is too good to be true; but it is part of the extraordinary Venetian ability to supplant history with myth. As the German poet, Rilke, said on a visit to the city in 1920, "as with mirrors one grasps nothing but is only drawn into the secret of its elusiveness. One is filled with images all day long, but could not substantiate a single one of them. Venice is a matter of faith."<br><br>In fact Venice emerged over a century later, after a series of invasions by the Lombards in the late 560s and early 570s. Once more the province of Venetia was overcome by alien tribes. Unlike the Huns, however, they did not wish to plunder and depart. They intended to stay and to settle. They overran what is now called in their name the region of Lombardy. Their arrival prompted a mass exodus of the Veneti. The bishop of Aquileia moved his see to the edge of the lagoon at Grado. The bishop of Padua removed himself to Malamocco, and the bishop of Oderzo sailed to Heraclea. These men were secular as well as religious leaders; they took citizens as well as congregations, ready to create new communities on the water. Burano and Murano were extensively settled, as well as smaller islands such as Ammiana and Constanziaca; these last two disappeared beneath the waves in the thirteenth century, swallowed up by the main enemy of the island people. They have never rested in their battle against the sea.<br><br>Venice was born in this flight from the Lombards. The most recent archaeological investigations have dated the first signs of human habitation to the second half of the sixth century and to the seventh century; these remains were situated in the neighbourhood of Castello, in the east of the city, and beneath Saint Mark's Square. There is evidence, too, that in these early years work had already begun on raising the surface of the land and reclaiming earth from water. The settlers fenced the soil with planks and poles; they drained the water; they laid down building rubble, or sediment, or sand from the dunes; they erected wooden palisades to resist the sea. It is the beginning of the city.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Great Northern?</h2><p><b>The Swallows, Amazons and Ds are united again for Arthur Ransome's final story in the series.</b> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flat on his front, binoculars to his eyes, alone at dusk, Dick makes a remarkable discovery: two rare birds, never before seen in the British Isles.

I know only a few factoids that I didn&#x2019;t know before. It&#x2019;s much too high a price to pay for the satisfaction of curiosity, needless to say.<br>Since being dead &#x2014; since achieving this state of bonelessness, liplessness, breastlessness &#x2014; I&#x2019;ve learned some things I would rather not know, as one does when listening at windows or opening other people&#x2019;s letters. You think you&#x2019;d like to read minds? Think again.<br><br>Down here everyone arrives with a sack, like the sacks used to keep the winds in, but each of these sacks is full of words &#x2014; words you&#x2019;ve spoken, words you&#x2019;ve heard, words that have been said about you. Some sacks are very small, others large; my own is of a reasonable size, though a lot of the words in it concern my eminent husband. What a fool he made of me, some say. It was a specialty of his: making fools. He got away with everything, which was another of his specialties: getting away.<br><br>He was always so plausible. Many people have believed that his version of events was the true one, give or take a few murders, a few beautiful seduct�resses, a few one-eyed monsters. Even I believed him, from time to time. I knew he was tricky and a liar, I just didn&#x2019;t think he would play his tricks and try out his lies on me. Hadn&#x2019;t I been faithful? Hadn&#x2019;t I waited, and waited, and waited, despite the temptation &#x2014; almost the compulsion &#x2014; to do otherwise? And what did I amount to, once the official version gained ground? An edifying legend. A stick used to beat other women with. Why couldn&#x2019;t they be as considerate, as trustworthy, as all-suffering as I had been? That was the line they took, the singers, the yarn-spinners. Don&#x2019;t follow my example, I want to scream in your ears &#x2014; yes, yours! But when I try to scream, I sound like an owl.<br><br>Of course I had inklings, about his slipperiness, his wiliness, his foxiness, his &#x2014; how can I put this? &#x2014; his unscrupulousness, but I turned a blind eye. I kept my mouth shut; or, if I opened it, I sang his praises. I didn&#x2019;t contradict, I didn&#x2019;t ask awkward questions, I didn&#x2019;t dig deep. I wanted happy endings in those days, and happy endings are best achieved by keeping the right doors locked and going to sleep during the rampages.<br><br>But after the main events were over and things had become less legendary, I realized how many people were laughing at me behind my back &#x2014; how they were jeering, making jokes about me, jokes both clean and dirty; how they were turning me into a story, or into several stories, though not the kind of stories I&#x2019;d prefer to hear about myself. What can a woman do when scandalous gossip travels the world? If she defends herself she sounds guilty. So I waited some more.<br><br>Now that all the others have run out of air, it&#x2019;s my turn to do a little story-making. I owe it to myself. I&#x2019;ve had to work myself up to it: it&#x2019;s a low art, tale-telling. Old women go in for it, strolling beggars, blind singers, maidservants, children &#x2014; folks with time on their hands. Once, people would have laughed if I&#x2019;d tried to play the minstrel &#x2014; there&#x2019;s nothing more preposterous than an aristocrat fumbling around with the arts &#x2014; but who cares about public opinion now? The opinion of the people down here: the opinion of shadows, of echoes. So I&#x2019;ll spin a thread of my own.<br><br>The difficulty is that I have no mouth through which I can speak. I can&#x2019;t make myself understood, not in your world, the world of bodies, of tongues and fingers; and most of the time I have no listeners, not on your side of the river. Those of you who may catch the odd whisper, the odd squeak, so easily mistake my words for breezes rustling the dry reeds, for bats at twilight, for bad dreams.<br><br>But I&#x2019;ve always been of a determined nature.

I never knew exactly why, during my lifetime, but now I suspect he&#x2019;d been told by an oracle that I would weave his shroud. Possibly he thought that if he killed me first, his shroud would never be woven and he would live forever. I can see how the reasoning might have gone. In that case, his wish to drown me came from an understandable desire to protect himself. But he must have misheard, or else the oracle herself misheard &#x2014; the gods often mumble &#x2014; because it was not his shroud that was at issue, but my father-in-law&#x2019;s shroud.

I experienced pain I could never have imagined before. Cancer destroyed my teen years and my twenties, but I was <i>determined </i>to survive.<br><br>I'd just turned sixteen the first time I was diagnosed, and I learned to knit while undergoing chemotherapy. A woman with breast cancer, who had the chemo chair next to mine, used to knit and she's the one who taught me. The chemo was dreadful&#x2014;not quite as bad as the headaches, but close. Because of knitting, I was able to endure those endless hours of weakness and severe nausea. With two needles and a skein of yarn, I felt I could face whatever I had to. My hair fell out in clumps, but I could weave yarn around a needle and create a stitch; I could follow a pattern and finish a project.

That probably won't seem earth-shattering to anyone else, but for me, it was a leap of faith equal to Noah's building the ark without a rain cloud in sight. I had an inheritance from my grandparents and gambled every cent on starting my own business. Me, who's never held down a job for more than a few weeks. Me, who knew next to nothing about finances, profit-and-loss statements or business plans.

But when his lifelong friend Lady Jane asks for his help, Lenox cannot resist another chance to unravel a mystery, even if it means trudging through the snow to her townhouse next door.<br>One of Jane&#x2019;s former servants, Prudence Smith, is dead &#x2013; an apparent suicide. But Lenox suspects something far more sinister: murder, by a rare and deadly poison. The house where the girl worked is full of suspects, and though Prudence dabbled with the hearts of more than a few men, Lenox is baffled by an elusive lack of motive in the girl&#x2019;s death.&nbsp;When another body turns up during the London season&#x2019;s most fashionable ball, Lenox must untangle a web of loyalties and animosities. Was it jealousy that killed Prudence? Or was it something else entirely, something that Lenox alone can uncover before the killer strikes again &#x2013; disturbingly close to home?</p><p>Charles Finch&nbsp;is a graduate of Yale and Oxford, and has worked in politics. This is his first novel.A Beautiful Blue Death (Chapter One)<p>The fateful note came just as Lenox was settling into his armchair after a long, tiresome day in the city. He read it slowly, handed it back to Graham, and told him to throw it away. Its contents gave him a brief moment of preoccupation, but then, with a slight frown, he picked up the evening edition of the <i>Standard</i> and asked for his tea.</p><p>It was a bitterly cold late afternoon in the winter of 1865, with snow falling softly over the cobblestones of London. The clock had just chimed five o'clock, and darkness was dropping across the city--the gas lights were on, the shops had begun to close, and busy men filled the streets, making their way home.</p><p>It was the sort of day when Lenox would have liked to sit in his library, tinkering with a few books, pulling down atlases and maps, napping by the fire, eating good things, writing notes to his friends and correspondents, and perhaps even braving the weather to walk around the block once or twice.</p><p>But alas, such a day wasn't meant to be. He had been forced to go down to the Yard, even though he had already given Inspector Exeter what he thought was a tidy narrative of the Isabel Lewes case.</p><p>It had been an interesting matter, the widely reported Marlborough forgery--interesting, but, in the end, relatively simple. The family should never have had to call him in. It was such a characteristic failure for Exeter: lack of imagination. Lenox tried to be kind, but the inspector irritated him beyond all reason. What part of the man's mind forbade him from imagining that a woman, even as dignified a woman as Isabel Lewes, could commit a crime? You could be proper or you could investigate. Not both. Exeter was the sort of man who had joined the Yard partly for power and partly because of a sense of duty, but never because it was his true vocation.</p><p>Well, well, at least it was done. His bones were chilled straight through, and he had a pile of unanswered letters on his desk, but at least it was done. He scanned the headlines of the newspaper, which drooped precariously over his legs, and absentmindedly warmed his hands and feet by the large bright fire.</p><p>What bliss was there to compare to a warm fire, fresh socks, and buttered toast on a cold day! Ah, and here was his tea, and Lenox felt that at last he could banish Exeter, the Yard, and female criminals from his mind forever.</p><p>He sat in a long room on the first floor of his house. Nearest the door was a row of windows that looked out over the street he lived on, Hampden Lane. Opposite the windows was a large hearth, and in front of the hearth were a few armchairs, mostly made of red leather, where he was sitting now, and little tables piled high with books and papers. There were also two leather sofas in the middle of the room, and by the window a large oak desk. On the other two walls there were oak bookshelves that held the library he had collected over the years.</p><p>Lenox was a man of perhaps forty, with brown hair still untouched by age. He had been lean in his youth, and now, though he weighed more, he was still a tall thin man who stood erect, though without the uncomfortably ascetic bearing of many tall thin men. He had bright cheeks, a pleasant smile, and a short beard, such as men in Parliament were wont to wear. His eyes were a clear hazel and occasionally betrayed his geniality, for they would sharpen when he was absorbed with an idea or a suspicion.</p><p>If at twenty he had been single-minded and occasionally obsessive, at forty he had mellowed and now preferred to sit in front of a warm fire, reading the newspaper with a cup of tea in his hand. He had always loved his friends and his family dearly but took more pleasure in them now. He had always loved his work but allowed himself to be diverted from it more often now. It had simply happened that he had never married, and now he was a thorough bachelor, comfortable company but set in his ways and a good deal more snug at home than in the first ambition of his youth. Lenox hadn't changed, in his own estimation; and yet of course he had, as all men do.</p><p>The tea tray sat on a small side table by his chair, next to a stack of books, several of which had fallen to the floor, where he had left them the night before. The servants had learned by now to leave his library as he left it, except for an occasional dusting. He poured a healthy cup of tea, took a large scoop of sugar and a splash of milk, and then turned his attention to the plate of toast. Graham had thoughtfully added a small cake, which was a rare treat. But then, it had been a trying day.</p><p>After several cups of tea, a few pieces of toast, and a slice of the cake, he pushed the tray away with a feeling of contentment, dropped his paper on the floor, and picked up a slim leather volume. It was a recently published edition of <i>The Small House at Allington,</i> which he was reading slowly in order to savor it. Today he would give himself two chapters: another small reward for coping with both Inspector Exeter and the fearsome weather.</p><p>Graham came in after a moment to take away the tray.</p><p>"Excuse the interruption, sir," he said, "but will there be a reply to Lady Grey's letter?"</p><p>"It's horribly cold outside, Graham."</p><p>"Indeed, sir?"</p><p>"Really horribly cold. You expect a seal to stroll by you on the street."</p><p>"Are you warm now, sir?"</p><p>"Yes, a little better. I was only thinking about the cold."</p><p>"Sir?"</p><p>Lenox sighed. "I suppose I'll have to go next door, though." There was a pause while he looked glumly into the fire.</p><p>"To Lady Grey's, sir?" said Graham.</p><p>Lenox didn't respond. He continued to look glum. Finally he said, "Yes, to Lady Grey's. I hate to do it, though."</p><p>"I'm sorry to hear that, sir," said Graham.</p><p>"It's beastly cold outside."</p><p>"It is, sir."</p><p>Lenox looked more and more glum. "Can't be helped, I expect," he said.</p><p>"No, sir."</p><p>Lenox sighed. "Will you get my things, then?"</p><p>"Of course, sir," said Graham. "Does this mean that you don't wish to reply--"</p><p>"No, no, no. That's why I'm going over."</p><p>"Very good, sir."</p><p>As the butler left, Lenox stood up and walked over to the window behind his desk. He had been looking forward to a night in by the fire, but he was being foolish, he thought. It was only a house away. He should put his boots on--they were tossed under his desk, next to an open copy of <i>Much</i>, <i>Ado</i>--and get ready to go. They would be just about dry, he hoped. And in truth he looked forward to seeing her.</p><p>Lady Jane Grey was a childless widow of just past thirty, who lived in the next house over. She was one of his closest friends in the world. This had been the case ever since they were children in Sussex. Sir Edmund, Charles's older brother, had once been in love with Lady Jane, but that was when they were all much younger, when Charles was just out of Harrow and on his way to Oxford.</p><p>Lenox and Lady Jane were neighbors on Hampden Lane, living next to each other in a row of gray stone houses on a little slip of an alley just off of St. James's Park in the neighborhood of Mayfair. As it had been for some time, Mayfair was the most prestigious address in London--and yet he had decided to live there because it was so near St. James's, where Lenox had gone with his father when he was a child.</p><p>The park was surrounded by palaces: Buckingham Palace to the left, St. James's Palace to the right, and Westminster Palace, more commonly known as Parliament, straight ahead. Like so many parks in London it had begun life as a place for Henry VIII to shoot deer, but Charles II, whom Lenox had always been fond of as a schoolboy, had opened it to the public and had often fed the ducks there himself, where he could talk with his subjects. Only thirty years ago they had changed all the canals into lakes, bred swans on the lakes, and planted beautiful willow trees. People skated there in the winter and walked through the brilliant green fields in the summer, and no matter what season it was, Lenox took a walk through it most nights--at least when he didn't have a case.</p><p>As he looked through the window of his library, Lenox could see the chimneys on Hampden Lane giving off black wisps of smoke, as his own did, and he could see that all of the houses were brightly lighted, and inside all of them tea was either on the table or had just been finished.</p><p>He stepped back from his window and told himself that he would see about the note in a few minutes. Perhaps Jane would have another cup of tea for him, at any rate. For now, he picked up the evening paper again and read with great interest, while Graham arranged his things, about the parries that Disraeli and Russell were trading back and forth; for Parliament was just back in session.</p><p>A BEAUTIFUL BLUE DEATH.
